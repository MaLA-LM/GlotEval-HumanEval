Det er en rekke faktorer som utgjør en øl smakprofil og en del av gleden av brygging ditt eget øl hjemme, er at du kan leke med hver av disse for å endre smaken og karakteren av din homebrew øl. Her er fem måter du kan endre din egen hjemmelaget oppskrift for å legge til interessante smaker eller alternativt kan du endre en eksisterende hjemmelaget oppskrift delt av noen andre eller et bryggeri.  1. Bruk forskjellige humle Det finnes et stort utvalg humle som er tilgjengelig for hjemmebryggere, og hver av disse kan introdusere sin egen spesielle smak og aroma til ølet ditt, alt fra ananas og aprikoser, til furutrær og skog, til grapefrukt og sitronkjøtt. Ved å bruke en annen humle i oppskriften din, enten fra samme familie eller fra en helt annen familie av humle, kan du enkelt legge til interessante og ofte radikale endringer i smaksprofilen til øl. Avhengig av når humlen er tilsatt i bryggingsprosessen, kan du imidlertid også øke/minske nivåene av bitterhet i ølet ditt, på grunn av at forskjellige humlevarianter har forskjellige nivåer av alfa-syrer.  2. Det Bruk en annen gjær I tillegg til å gjære ølet, etterlater gjær mange interessante smaker og kan gi ditt hjemmebryggeri sin egen subtile karakter. For eksempel kan engelske gjærstammer legge til malt og søt smak, California gjær har en tendens til å skape en ren og sprø øl, mens sesong gjær legger til lyse og fruktede smaker til øl.  3. Bruk forskjellige korn Å endre mengden base malt kan øke eller redusere alkoholen i ferdig øl. Prøver å bytte en base malt for en annen, som amerikanske blek malt for en britisk sort, og se etter de subtile forskjellene mellom dem. Du kan også leke deg med de spesielle kornene, som å bruke en litt mørkere stekt.  4. Legg til frukt, krydder eller urter Frukt, krydder, urter og andre ingredienser er en fin måte å legge til en helt personlig karakter til din hjemmebrygg. Alt fra friske jordbær og basilikum til vanilje bønner og kardamom kan virkelig utfylle de andre maltede, humle smakene i et øl.  5. Det er ikke sant. Endre vannprofilen din Forskjellige øltyper vil vanligvis best oppnås med en passende vannprofil, med forskjellige nivåer av mineraler for å oppnå den ønskede smaksprofilen. Ved å justere mengden av bestemte mineraler som finnes i bryggvannet ditt, kan øl lages til å smake fyldigere, søtere, tørrere, bitrere eller til og med surere.", "output": "er.

This means that the gases from the combustion of the fuel and air mix together and are expelled as a force. The gases are expelled from the cylinder of the engine as a result of the expansion of the gases.

Vil du ha en tradisjonell forbrenningsmotor, eller en elektrisk? - Antall sylindere: Hvis du velger forbrenningsmotor, hvor mange sylindere velger du? Færre sylindere er vanligvis billigere, gjør motorsykkel lettere og dermed lettere å manøvrere. Flere sylindere gjør at motoren føles jevnere, har også mer kraft, men er tyngre og dyrere. - Bruk: Hva bruker du den til? Bare for moro skyld, pendling til jobb, generell transport? Reise? Offroad? Løp? - Assistancesystemer: Moderne motorsykler har en rekke assistancesystemer som ABS, fartskontroll, avstandssensorer, elektroniske kjøremoduser for ulike værforhold osv. De kan gjøre kjøring tryggere, men også legge til vekt og gjøre sykkelen dyrere.

Den forårsaket skader på 550 millioner dollar i Chile, mens tsunamien som den skapte forårsaket dødsfall og skader så langt unna som Hawaii, Japan og Filippinene. Jordskjelvet var mer enn 1000 km langt. To dager etter det første jordskjelvet, den nærliggende vulkanen Puyehue brøt ut, sender aske og damp opp til 6 km i atmosfæren over en periode på flere uker.  2. Det Prince William Sound, Alaska 28. mars 1964 (magnitude 9,2) Sammenlignet med det chilenske jordskjelvet, var dette jordskjelvet mindre skadelig: den resulterende tsunamien tok 128 liv og forårsaket totalt 311 millioner dollar i skade. Jordskjelvet ble hovedsakelig følt over Alaska, så vel som noen steder i Canada, mens tsunamien som ble skapt av det forårsaket skader så langt unna som Hawaii. Den største skaden ble påført av byen Anchorage, 120 km nordvest for epicentret. Skjelving fra jordskjelvet selv er rapportert å ha varte i tre minutter.  3.

Totalt ble 227.900 mennesker drept eller antatt døde, med rundt 1,7 millioner fordrevne over 14 land i Sør-Asia og Øst-Afrika. Epicentret var 250 km sørøst for Band Aceh, Indonesia, på en dybde på 30 km. Flere dager senere den 28. desember begynte en gjørmevulkan å bryte ut nær Baratang, Andamarøyene, som antas å ha vært assosiert med jordskjelvet.  4. Sendai, Japan 11. mars 2011 (størrelse 9,0) Så langt er det offisielle dødsfallstallet på flere tusen fra den kombinerte effekten av det kraftige jordskjelvet, etterskjelv og tsunamien. Det totale antallet forventes imidlertid å øke, med noen estimater på en endelig dødstall på over 10.000.

Kamchatka, Russland 4. november 1952 (magnitude 9.0) Dette jordskjelvet genererte en tsunami som forårsaket omfattende skader på Hawaii-øyene. Eiendomsskaden ble anslått til rundt US $ 1.000.000. Noen rapporter beskriver bølger over 9 meter høye på Kaena Point, Oahu. En bonde på Oahu rapporterte at han hadde mistet seks kuer i tsunamien, men ingen mennesker ble rapportert drept.  6 år.

Mer enn 800 000 mennesker ble fordrevet med totalt 1,8 millioner mennesker rammet over hele Chile, hvor skaden ble anslått til US $ 30 milliarder. Epicentret var 335 km sørvest for Santiago, på en dybde av 35 km. En mindre tsunami reiste over Stillehavet og forårsaket skader på båter så langt unna som San Diego, California.  7. Ved kysten av Ecuador 31. januar 1906 (magnitude 8,8) Dette jordskjelvet forårsaket en tsunami som ble rapportert å ha drept mellom 500 og 1.500 i Ecuador og Colombia. Tsunamien reiste så langt nord som San Francisco, på vestkysten av USA, og vest til Hawaii og Japan. Tsunamien tok omtrent 12 timer å krysse Stillehavet til Hilo, Hawaii.  8. Rat Islands, Alaska 2. april 1965 (magnitude 8,7) Den verste av skadene tilskrevet dette jordskjelvet ble forårsaket av en tsunami, rapportert å være ca 10 m høy på Shemya Island. Bølgen forårsaket oversvømmelse på Amchitka Island, forårsaket US $ 10.000 i eiendomsskader. Ingen døde eller skadde ble rapportert.  9.

Avhengige kommunistiske regjeringer ble installert i østblokken satellittstater. Etter å ha blitt verdens andre atommakt, etablerte Sovjetunionen Warszawa-pakten alliansen, og gikk inn i en kamp for global dominans, kjent som den kalde krigen, med rivaliserende USA og NATO. Etter Stalins død i 1953 og en kort periode med kollektivt styre, fordømte den nye lederen Nikita Khrusjtsjov Stalin og lanserte avstaliniseringspolitikken, og frigjorde mange politiske fanger fra Gulag-arbeidsleirene. Den generelle avlastningen av undertrykkende politikk ble senere kjent som Khrushchev Thaw. På samme tid nådde den kalde krigens spenninger sitt høydepunkt da de to rivalene kolliderte over utplasseringen av USAs Jupiter-missiler i Tyrkia og sovjetiske missiler i Cuba.  I 1957 lanserte Sovjetunionen verdens første kunstige satellitt, Sputnik 1, og startet dermed romtidsalderen. Den russiske kosmonauten Yuri Gagarin ble den første mennesket til å gå i bane rundt jorden, ombord på Vostok 1 bemannet romfartøy den 12. april 1961. Etter at Khrusjtsjov ble avsatt i 1964, fulgte en annen periode med kollektiv styre, til Leonid Bresjnev ble leder. Epoken på 1970-tallet og tidlig på 1980-tallet ble senere utpekt som Stagnasjonens æra. Kosygin-reformen i 1965 hadde som mål å desentralisere den sovjetiske økonomien. I 1979, etter en kommunistisk ledet revolusjon i Afghanistan, invaderte sovjetiske styrker landet, og startet til slutt den sovjetisk-afghanske krigen. I mai 1988 begynte Sovjetunionen å trekke seg tilbake fra Afghanistan, på grunn av internasjonal motstand, vedvarende antisovjetisk geriljakrig, og mangel på støtte fra sovjetiske borgere.  Fra 1985 og framover, den siste sovjetiske lederen Mikhail Gorbatsjov, som forsøkte å vedta liberale reformer i det sovjetiske systemet, introduserte politikken av glasnost (åpenhet) og perestroika (omstrukturering) i et forsøk på å avslutte perioden med økonomisk stagnasjon og å demokratisere regjeringen. Dette førte imidlertid til fremveksten av sterke nasjonalistiske og separatistiske bevegelser over hele landet. Før 1991 var den sovjetiske økonomien verdens nest største, men i sine siste år gikk den inn i en krise.  I 1991 begynte den økonomiske og politiske uroen å koke over da de baltiske statene valgte å løsrive seg fra Sovjetunionen. Den 17. mars ble det avholdt en folkeavstemning, hvor det store flertallet av de deltakende borgerne stemte for å endre Sovjetunionen til en fornyet føderasjon. I juni 1991 ble Boris Jeltsin den første direkte valgte presidenten i russisk historie da han ble valgt til president i den russiske SFSR. I august 1991 førte et kuppforsøk fra medlemmer av Gorbatsjovs regjering, rettet mot Gorbatsjov og rettet mot å bevare Sovjetunionen, i stedet til slutten av Sovjetunionens kommunistparti.

{"model_name": "wenge-research/yayi-7b", "input": "Skriv et brev til mamma og pappa og fortell hvorfor de burde kjøpe meg en dyreskildpadde.", "target": "Kjære mamma og pappa,  Som du vet, har jeg ønsket et kjæledyr skilpadde for noen tid nå. Jeg har tenkt mye over det og gjort mye forskning på hva som kan være involvert. Jeg er klar over at det å ha et kjæledyr er en stor forpliktelse så jeg skriver til deg for å forklare hvorfor jeg tror du bør kjøpe meg et kjæledyr skilpadde og hvorfor en skilpadde er et fantastisk valg av kjæledyr.  Å ta vare på et kjæledyr skilpadde vil gi meg en sterk følelse av ansvar. Jeg vet at jeg må sørge for at min skilpadde er godt matet, holdt på riktig temperatur, gitt muligheter til å basse under en oppvarmet lampe eller i solskinnet hvis det er varmt nok. Jeg er veldig villig til å gi den tiden og forpliktelsen som er nødvendig for å ta vare på min skilpadde. Skildpadden vil være mitt eget ansvar og jeg føler meg moden nok til å forplikte seg til sin omsorg og lykke.  Som du vet, lider jeg av angst og skolen gjør meg spesielt bekymret noen ganger. Det har blitt vist gjennom mange studier at kjæledyr reduserer angst og stress hos mennesker. Jeg føler meg sikker på at å ha en skilpadde vil være en fantastisk distraksjon fra mine bekymringer og gi meg stor glede. I motsetning til populær tro, elsker skilpadder å få sine skall strøket og deres kinn kitlet og jeg tror det ville være veldig avslappende for meg å klappe en skilpadde når jeg kommer hjem fra skolen.  Skilpadder er svært selvforsynt. Forutsatt at de får et varmt sted å sole seg, tilgang til ferskvann og rikelig med fersk mat som løvetann, grønnkål, salat og andre bladgrønnsaker, er de veldig glade for å bli overlatt til sine egne enheter. Siden vi bor i Storbritannia hvor temperaturen kan være kald, må vi kjøpe et skilpaddebord med godt substrat, en sollampe og noen skinn hvor skilpadden kan stikke seg bort. Vi har mye plass til dette i kjøkkenet vårt. Når det er varmt, kan skilpadden gå inn i hagen vår i et gjerde. Et skilpaddebord og lampe vil koste ca £200 men dette er bare en innledende utgift. Deretter er det veldig billig å holde en skilpadde. Faktisk kan du plukke de fleste av deres mat gratis ved foraging som jeg er glad for å gjøre når vi går for familier gå.  I motsetning til populær tro, kan skilpadder være veldig vennlige. Som jeg nevnte ovenfor, elsker de å bli stryket, men visste du også at de kan gjenkjenne sine eiere og noen kan til og med reagere på deres navn? Faktisk viste en studie at skilpadder kan gjenkjenne sine tidligere eiere som de ikke har sett i årevis så de er både vennlige og veldig intelligente. Du er kanskje bekymret for å la en skilpadde dvale, men jeg har gjort mye research på dette og vet nå nøyaktig hva jeg skal gjøre. Hvis vi kjøper en skilpadde, vil den trenge å dvale i maksimalt tre måneder fra slutten av september. Vi må overvinrere skilpadden vår i en godt isolert boks. Temperaturen må ikke gå over eller under 5 grader celsius og vårt garasje ville være det perfekte stedet for det. Vi har en temperaturmåler der så jeg kan holde øye med varmen.  Til slutt har jeg sett på kostnaden for å kjøpe en skilpadde. Jeg vil foreslå at vi kjøper en skilpadde som er et par år gammel, da de krever mindre omsorg. Vi kan kjøpe en forelsket skilpadde som har blitt mikrochippet for rundt 100 pund. Og når vi drar på ferie, har jeg funnet et Tortoise Hotel som drives av en veterinær og koster bare £ 60 for et 10-dagers opphold.  Jeg tror du vil være enig i at jeg har gjennomført svært grundig forskning på å ta vare på en skilpadde og jeg håper du vil være enig i at jeg nå er moden nok til å ta vare på et kjæledyr. Jeg tror virkelig at et kjæledyr skilpadde vil gi meg en sterk følelse av ansvar og vil ha en positiv beroligende effekt på humøret mitt. Ja, jeg tror hele familien vil nyte å ha en skilpadde. De er vennlige, kjærlige, interessante og intelligente dyr og vi vil alle ha nytte av å ha en.  Jeg ville være takknemlig hvis du ville gi min forespørsel full vurdering.

{"model_name": "wenge-research/yayi-7b", "input": "Skriv en oppgave om hvorvidt corona-politikk tiltak er gunstig mot samfunnet eller ikke", "target": "Etter nesten to år med COVID-19-pandemien og enda en innestengning, blir mange mennesker rundt om i Nederland rastløse og har fått nok av restriksjonene. Ifølge Rijksoverheid ble en rekord høy 74.000 tilfeller bekreftet i Nederland den 28. januar, med bare ti corona-relaterte ICU-innleggelser eller dødsfall (<unk>Infeksjoner - Bekreftede tilfeller<unk>, 2022). Dette reiser debatten: bør regjeringen fortsette å håndheve disse tiltakene eller ikke? For å formulere et svar må man først forstå viruset og hvordan det sprer seg, og deretter vurdere debatten fra politiske, etiske, sosiale og økonomiske perspektiver. Det første rapporterte tilfellet av SARS-CoV-2, som forårsaker COVID-19-sykdommen, var den 31. desember 2019 (\"Koronavirus sykdom\", 2022), og det satte i gang en kjedereaksjon av politisk ustabilitet over hele verden. Det som først startet som en epidemi i Kina hadde nådd nesten alle land i verden i løpet av måneder. I de siste 20 årene har mange land blitt påvirket av virus relatert til Covid-19 som SARS. På grunn av tidligere erfaring, tok de passende tiltak umiddelbart. For eksempel har Kina ikke hatt mer enn 110.000 tilfeller siden pandemien startet, selv om det har en befolkning på nesten 1,5 milliarder (Worldometer, 2022). Men et mindre politisk stabilt land, som Tyrkia, var mindre forberedt og led av 12 millioner tilfeller, selv om det har en befolkning på 85 millioner. Viruset sprer seg veldig raskt på grunn av den luftbårne overføringsmekanismen. Hvis man er i nærheten av en infisert person, kan utåndingen fra den som er smittet bære viruset og kan inhaleres av friske personer. Å bruke maske og holde avstand hjelper til med å forhindre at infiserte personer sprer viruspartikler i nærheten av friske mennesker. I land der tiltakene ikke ble håndhevet, var det imidlertid en stor økning i overdreven død. Den nye omikronvarianten viser seg å spre seg minst 20 ganger raskere enn den opprinnelige stammen på grunn av sine 30 mutasjoner (Grossman og Stahel, 2022). Heldigvis er det også langt mindre dødelig fordi det ikke angriper lungefett i sine tidligere stadier (Zimmer og Ghorayshi, 2021). Man kan også analysere koronavirus-begrensninger fra et etisk perspektiv: bør vi redusere koronastriksjonene selv om det kan sette flere liv i fare? Fra 28. januar 2021 har coronavirus en dødelighet på 0,51%. Dette er relativt høyt sammenlignet med andre respiratoriske virus som influensa, som har en dødelighet på 0, 01%. COVID-19 påvirker uforholdsmessig sårbare grupper, for eksempel de med underliggende helsemessige forhold som diabetes, fedme eller autoimmune sykdommer. Dette gjelder spesielt hos eldre, på grunn av økt antall helseproblemer samt et immunsystem som forverres med alderen. Coronavirus infiserer de øvre luftveiene, inkludert lungene. Den bryter seg inn i celler og beordrer dem til å lage kopier av viruset. Cellen springer deretter opp og sender nye kopier av viruset mot andre celler. Til slutt, hvis det ikke er en effektiv immunrespons, vil pasienten dø på grunn av lungeskade, spesielt med COVID-19-stammer før Omicron-varianten. Under en innestengning er det minimal menneskelig kontakt, noe som reduserer spredningen av viruset. Å hindre sosial kontakt har imidlertid sine egne ødeleggende effekter. For eksempel var det i løpet av innestengningen over 2,5 millioner barn i fare for å falle bak på læring (<unk>Jongeren<unk> 2021') (\"Education and COVID-19\", 2022). Videre, ifølge OSF Healthcare, \"Gjennomsnittlige ukentlige besøk til beredskapsavdelingen for mistenkte selvmordsforsøk blant unge jenter var opp mer enn 50% fra samme periode for ett år siden\" (OSF Health Care, 2021). Selv om flere liv er satt på spill, kan man ved å ta ekstra tiltak for de i risikogruppen trygt åpne samfunnet igjen og forhindre selvmord og læringsvansker hos ungdom. Dessuten kan vaksiner i utgangspunktet forhindre at større skade på vev oppstår. Fra et samfunnsperspektiv har coronavirus vist seg å være et \"splinterproblem\" som har fått noen mennesker til å nekte å ta vaksine. Mange borgere avstår fra å få vaksiner uten virkelig å forstå konsekvensene. Det finnes to typer vaksiner: mRNA og virusvektor. mRNA COVID-19-vaksinen var den første mRNA-vaksinen som ble brukt i allmennheten. mRNA-vaksiner har RNA inne i lipider som hjelper RNA å komme inn i cellen. Ribosomer leser RNA og instruerer cellene til å lage de samme spike proteiner som SARS-CoV-2. Kroppen gjenkjenner da at Corona spike proteiner er inntrengere og skaper antistoffer for å ødelegge dem. Til sammenligning, virusvektor vaksiner setter inn en ufarlig kopi av viruset med samme spike protein DNA, forårsaker immunsystemet til å angripe det og huske det. For begge typer vaksiner vil hukommelses- B- celler fortsette å skape antistoffer i tilfelle personen blir utsatt for det virkelige viruset i fremtiden. Ifølge Dr. Stahel, <unk>Omicron har mutert så mye at det har mindre affinitet når det gjelder antistoffer fra vaksinen som gjenkjenner det, så derfor er svaret booster shot, fordi du vil overvelde viruset med mengden av immunresponsen selv om det ikke er en perfekt match<unk> (Grossman og Stahel, 2022). Således spiller de opprinnelige vaksindosisene og, mer nylig, boostershot en viktig rolle i å forebygge infeksjoner, men enda viktigere i å redusere sjansen for alvorlig sykdom og død. Nye studier har imidlertid vist at effektiv immunitet kan avta innen seks måneder, noe som gjør det nødvendig å få årlige doser, som ligner på influensa (Doucleff). 13,6% av befolkningen over 18 år nekter å bli vaksinert, hovedsakelig på grunn av mistillit til regjeringen (<unk>Vaccinations COVID-19 vaccinations<unk>, 2022). Dette begrenser effekten av flokkeimmunitet, et konsept der hvis nok mennesker blir vaksinert, vil viruset ikke lenger kunne spre seg på grunn av at alle målene er immune. Til slutt må man vurdere de økonomiske implikasjonene av en nedleggelse. Lockdown forårsaket kolossal arbeidsledighet, spesielt for de som jobbet i reiselivsbransjen. For eksempel, ifølge World Economic Forum, mistet 114 millioner mennesker jobben i løpet av 2020 (Richter, 2021). Videre forårsaket lockdowns over hele verden også et estimert tap på 3,2 billioner euro i arbeidsinntekter. Selv med de ødeleggende økonomiske effektene, må man vurdere det faktum at liv blir satt på spill når egnede koronakrav ikke tas. Ifølge NPR ville det vært omtrent 488 ganger så mange tilfeller i Kina hvis utilstrekkelige tiltak ble tatt, og dermed reddet millioner av liv (Beaubien, 2020). Til slutt, ved å vurdere COVID-19 fra en politisk, etisk, sosial og økonomisk linse, konkluderer jeg med at selv om viruset er svært smittsomt og dødelig mot visse grupper, er lockdowns bare midlertidige løsninger. En innestengning er bare gunstig for vårt samfunn når overdreven dødelighet begynner å stige. Ved å treffe tiltak tidlig kan landene begrense spredningen av viruset. For eksempel tok det seks måneder før maskering ble sett på som et levedyktig tiltak. Som det ble sett i den første innestengingen, mistet titusener av mennesker sine jobber og over 2,5 millioner barn måtte ta fjernundervisning i Nederland (\"Jongeren\", 2021). Ved å ta tiltak i tide og være forberedt, trenger man ikke å gå inn i lockdown. Men hvis dødsfallene begynner å bli overdreven, er det verdt å håndheve en proporsjonal mengde korona-tiltak.", "output": ".

Pengene går til utstyr og kakaobønner. For utstyr, vil du trenge en melanger (ca $ 600) for å mala bønner og en tempering maskin (ca $ 400) for å lage det ferdige produktet. Du trenger også en silikonmatte (ca. 20 dollar) og en hårføner (ca. 30 dollar). Men la oss starte fra begynnelsen.  Kjøp mellom to og seks pund av fermenterte rå kakaobønner. Det finnes en rekke importører på nett. Velg en enkelt sjokolade eller en blanding som passer deg.  Sortere bønner, fjerne knuste bønner, dårlig deformert bønner, og hva som helst fremmedlegemer kan være til stede.  Reste bønner, to pund av gangen, på 350 F for mellom 20 og 30 minutter, avhengig av din erfaring med bønner eller av hvordan de lukter. De kommer til å lukte som friske brownies. Ikke brenne dem!  La bønnene kjøle.  Skjel bønnene. Du kan gjøre dette for hånd - som jeg finner produserer et overlegen produkt - men vær advart om at dette kan ta opptil 6 timer per pund. Alternativt kan du kjøpe en vinbryter og bruke hårtørkeren til å blåse ut skinnene. Denne tilnærmingen er mye raskere, men etterlater mer hud og mister flere bønnefragmenter. Uansett, veie din endelige bønneavkastning.  Få deg melanger går. Bruk hårtørkeren til å få sliping overflater opp til minst 120F. Legg en håndfull bønner til. Hjelp melanger langs hvis det blir sittende fast. Sørg for at melanger går jevnt før du forlater den uten tilsyn. Når det kommer i gang, vil det flyte godt.  Kjør blanderen i 24 til 72 timer, igjen avhengig av din erfaring med bønner og din smak. Hvis du prøver en blanding av bønner, kan du legge til de mer robuste aromatiske bønner tidlig i prosessen og de mer delikate aromatiske bønner senere. Gi selv de mest delikate bønner minst 8 timer. Legg til sukker etter smak. Prosentandelen sukker etter vekt kan variere fra noen få prosent opp til 30 prosent. Du kan også legge til tørket fullfett melk på dette punktet, og andre smakstilsetninger, som en tomme eller så av vanilje bønner. Bland sukker og andre tilsetningsstoffer i minst 8 timer til. Målet er å redusere partikkelstørrelsen under det som kan oppdages av tungen. Når du er ferdig, dekanter i en silikon matte linje bakingspann. Dette er din tempererte sjokolade. Den smelter lett og har en tendens til å bli sprø som den alder. Det er derfor du vil temperere det.  Til slutt følger du instruksjonene på tempereringsmaskinen, og legger til stykker av ikke temperert sjokolade som angitt. Den flytende tempererte sjokoladen kan brukes til fruktdypning eller kan helles i former for barer eller formede godterier.

Eksperimenter for å fastslå effekten av Nature vs Nurture er vanskelige å utføre. Ikke bare fra et menneskerettighetsperspektiv, men også fra et variabel standpunkt. Virkelig er det altfor mange variabler å kontrollere med hensyn til menneskelig natur, at enhver pålegging av kontroll på Nurture elementet ville være ubalansert.

{"model_name": "wenge-research/yayi-7b", "input": "Hvorfor skal folk konvertere plener og dekorative hager til innfødte planter?", "target": "Hvem elsker ikke sommerfugler? De er et vakkert symbol på uskyld. Men har du lagt merke til at det er færre og færre hvert år? Da jeg var barn, kunne du ikke ta en tur uten å få noen sommerfugler på forruden på bilen din. Så hvorfor er det så få, og hva betyr det?  En av hovedårsakene er bruken av plantevernmidler og herbicider. Disse kjemikaliene er vilkårlige drapsmenn. Og de slår hele økosystemet ut av balanse. I min hage har jeg sett hvordan litt tålmodighet kan sette ting tilbake i balanse. Jeg hadde bladlus, men sakte la jeg merke til at bladlus rovdyr løste problemet. Jeg hadde fluer på grunn av kyllinghuset mitt, men i løpet av noen uker så jeg Swallows og Phoebes flytte inn for å dra nytte av matkilden.  Den andre grunnen til at vi ser færre sommerfugler er mat for larver. De fleste sommerfugler og sommerfugler (eller nattfugler som jeg liker å kalle dem) trenger en bestemt plante som vertskap for larvene sine. For monark sommerfugler, er det Milkweed (Asclepias), som er et uheldig navn for en vakker plante. For Pipevine Swallowtails er det Pipevine (Aristolochia). Uten disse plantene har larver ingen matkilde. Og etter hvert som byer og forsteder blir asfaltert over, er det ikke lenger noe sted for disse en gang rikelige plantene å vokse. Når vi ser på våre egne gårder, inneholder de vakre planter som er importert fra andre steder. Men for en sommerfugl, våre gårder synes som ørkener. Selv planter som bottlebrush, som tiltrekker seg mange insekter for nektar, gir ingen mat til innfødte baby insekter. Det er litt som å ha en bar for de voksne å drikke på, men ingen mat å gi næring til sine barn slik at de kan vokse til å bli voksne også.  Men Doug Tallamy, en entomolog fra University of Delaware, sier vi kan hjelpe. Ved å sette noen innfødte planter i våre gårder, kan vi gi maten til å bringe tilbake sommerfugler.  Mens vi forberedte oss på å gjøre om hagen vår fra eviggrønne prydplanter til en engelsk hytte/skåret blomsterhage, skjedde noe. Vi så Doug Tallamy snakke på et CNPS Silicon Valley Zoom-møte. Og vi innså at vi måtte endre retning, og begynne å hage med innfødte.  Når vi ser på vår hage, er nøkkelen at vi bare begynner... Det er et stort eksperiment for å se hva som fungerer hvor. Og allerede snakker hagen til oss. Den blåøyde gresset har hoppet den asfalterte gangveien til en annen del av hagen! Vi forventer mer bevegelse og magi i fremtiden. Her er noen av våre tanker om vår hage.  Velsignelser... å ha et gigantisk eik i hagen vår og å ha en bekk bak oss har sikkert gitt oss et ben opp når det gjelder mat og dyreliv tilgang til hagen vår.  Ulempen er at det er mye skygge. Bare to, kanskje tre steder i hagen vår som får god sol. Så, vi troller gjennom Calscape på jakt etter planter som vil tolerere skygge. (Hvis du ikke har møtt Calscape du er i for en godbit. Men jeg håper du bor i California...).  Målet er at vi som talamitter skal gi næring til økosystemet, som starter med larveoppdrett. Så hvordan har det fungert ut? Vel, vi har bare sett en eller to larver så langt. Åp. Det er et eksperiment...  Største innvirkning... etterlater bladene det siste året. Vi kan allerede se at jorda forbedrer seg, og hver gang vi vanner ser vi at mange insekter stiger opp fra søppel. Så det skjer. Sakte og rolig...

Ved å kombinere disse materialene til en enhet som kalles en transistor er vi i stand til å skape en elektronisk komponent som bare vil lede elektrisitet når en liten elektrisk strøm er brukt til den såkalte Base pin av transistoren.  En åpenbar bruk av en slik oppførsel er å bruke transistoren som en bryter - ved å bruke eller fjerne strøm til basen pin vi er i stand til å kontrollere om transistoren leder elektrisitet via sin kollektor og emittør pins. Når ingen strøm er til stede ved Base pin transistoren vil blokkere elektrisk overføring gjennom sin sender og samler pins.  Generelt sett er den elektriske strømmen som kreves for å styre transistoren ved basen pin veldig liten. Mye større strømmer kan overføres gjennom enheten gjennom kollektor og sender pins. Således bruker en transistor en svært liten inngangsstrøm til å kontrollere strømmen av en mye større strøm.

For å forsterke dette signalet slik at det er brukbart for lydspilling kan vi bruke lydsignalet til en transistors base pin - dette vil tillate en mye større strøm å strømme mellom emittenten og kollektoren pins og gjennom transistoren.

Statistisk sett er et mønster av preferanser lett synlig på hva folk vil beskrive som vakkert. Et tydelig eksempel på dette fenomenet er en skjønnhetsstandard for kvinner og menn. Samfunnet synes å være enige om hvilke egenskaper, både fysiske og indre, som kan anse en person som vakker. Standard av skjønnhet er også projisert utover mennesker, på dyr raser, for eksempel, i katteutstillinger. En sammenheng mellom skjønnhet og hvor nært det ligner perfeksjon synes å eksistere. For eksempel blir en rose med mange kronblad og ingen tårer eller riper generelt sett på som vakrere enn en med færre, synlig ødelagte kronblad. Imidlertid reiser spørsmålet om perfeksjon også et problem, da det er vanskelig og uten tvil umulig å definere perfeksjon. Skjønnhet betyr ikke nødvendigvis perfeksjon. For eksempel, store øyne er statistisk ansett for å være mer attraktivt men, når det gjelder deres biologiske formål de har ingen overlegenhet til små øyne. Derfor avhenger både skjønnhet og fullkommenhet av det perspektiv eller det formål du har med å observere et objekt.  Videre bør man også ta hensyn til de klare svingningene gjennom århundrer og kulturer i hva som anses å være vakkert. For eksempel endrer mote- og kunsttrender seg hele tiden. I tillegg tyder mangfoldet av meninger på at det ikke er noe som anses vakkert av alle, så selv om flertallet anser et bestemt objekt eller ting som vakkert, forblir skjønnheten subjektiv fordi den forblir basert på en stadig skiftende preferanse i stedet for objektiv sannhet.", "output": " Objective or subjective?

Tesla er et av verdens mest verdifulle selskaper og er, fra 2023, verdens mest verdifulle bilprodusent. I 2021 hadde selskapet det største verdensomspennende salget av batteridrevne elbiler og plug-in elbiler, og erobret 21% av batteridrevne elbiler (rent elektriske) og 14% av plug-in elbiler (som inkluderer plug-in hybrider). Gjennom datterselskapet Tesla Energy utvikler og installerer selskapet fotovoltaiske systemer i USA. Tesla Energy er også en av de største globale leverandørene av batteri-energisystemer, med 3,99 gigawatt-timer (GWh) installert i 2021.  Tesla ble etablert i juli 2003 av Martin Eberhard og Marc Tarpenning som Tesla Motors. Selskapets navn er en hyllest til oppfinner og elektrisk ingeniør Nikola Tesla. I februar 2004, via en investering på $ 6,5 millioner, ble Elon Musk den største aksjonæren i selskapet. Han har fungert som administrerende direktør siden 2008. Ifølge Musk er formålet med Tesla å bidra til å fremskynde overgangen til bærekraftig transport og energi, oppnådd gjennom elektriske kjøretøy og solenergi. Tesla startet produksjonen av sin første bilmodell, Roadster sportsbil, i 2008. Dette ble etterfulgt av Model S sedan i 2012, Model X SUV i 2015, Model 3 sedan i 2017, Model Y crossover i 2020, og Tesla Semi lastebil i 2022. Selskapet planlegger å starte produksjonen av Cybertruck lett-duty pickup truck i 2023. Model 3 er den aller bestselgende plug-in elektriske bilen over hele verden, og i juni 2021 ble den første elektriske bilen som solgte 1 million enheter globalt. Teslas 2022 hele året leveranser var rundt 1,31 millioner biler, en 40% økning i forhold til året før, og kumulativt salg totalt 3 millioner biler per august 2022. I oktober 2021 nådde Teslas markedsverdi 1 trillion dollar, det sjette selskapet som gjør det i amerikansk historie.  Tesla har vært gjenstand for flere søksmål, regjeringens granskning, journalistisk kritikk og offentlige kontroverser som oppstår fra uttalelser og handlinger av administrerende direktør Elon Musk og fra påstander om whistleblower hevn, brudd på arbeiderrettigheter og defekter med sine produkter.", "target": "Roadster, Model S, Model X, Model 3, Model Y, Tesla Semi, Cybertruck", "output": " Tesla Energy har 3,99 gigawatt-timer (GWh) installert i 2021.\nTesla Motors, Tesla Energy, and Tesla Semi are three separate entities, each with their own products and services.

Han informerer Kommisjonen om at et alternativ til denne fremtiden er oppnåelig og forklarer dem at å skape et kompendium av all menneskelig kunnskap, Encyclopedia Galactica, kan ikke forhindre imperiets uunngåelige fall, men ville redusere den mørke alderen til ett årtusen.  Den skeptiske Kommisjonen, som ikke ønsker å gjøre Seldon til en martyr, tilbyr ham eksil til en fjern verden, Terminus, med andre som kunne hjelpe ham med å lage Encyclopedia.

Navngitt etter kansler Otto von Bismarck, ble skipet lagt ned på Blohm & Voss verft i Hamburg i juli 1936 og lansert i februar 1939. Arbeidet ble fullført i august 1940, da hun ble utnevnt til den tyske flåten. Bismarck og hennes søsterskip Tirpitz var de største slagskipene noensinne bygget av Tyskland, og to av de største bygget av noen europeisk makt.  I løpet av krigsskipets åtte måneders karriere, gjennomførte Bismarck bare en offensiv operasjon som varte 8 dager i mai 1941, kodenavnet Rheinübung. Skipet, sammen med den tunge krysseren Prinz Eugen, skulle bryte seg inn i Atlanterhavet og raide allierte skipsfart fra Nord-Amerika til Storbritannia. De to skipene ble oppdaget flere ganger utenfor Skandinavia, og britiske marineenheter ble utplassert for å blokkere ruten deres. I slaget ved Danmarksundet, slagkrysseren HMS Hood innledningsvis engasjert Prinz Eugen, sannsynligvis ved en feil, mens HMS Prince of Wales engasjert Bismarck. I det påfølgende slaget ble Hood ødelagt av den kombinerte ilden fra Bismarck og Prinz Eugen, som da skadet Prince of Wales og tvang henne til å trekke seg tilbake. Bismarck fikk tilstrekkelig skade fra tre tre treff av Prince of Wales for å tvinge en slutt på raiding oppdrag.  Ødeleggelsen av Hood sporet en nådeløs forfølgelse av Royal Navy som involverer dusinvis av krigsskip. To dager senere, på vei til okkupert Frankrike for å utføre reparasjoner, ble Bismarck angrepet av femten Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombefly fra hangarskipet HMS Ark Royal; en scoret et treff som gjorde slagskipets styring utstyr ubrukbar. I sin siste kamp neste morgen, ble den allerede lammet Bismarck engasjert av to britiske slagskip og to tunge krysserer, og opprettholdt uførgjørende skade og tung tap av liv. Skipet ble scuttled for å hindre henne fra å bli ombord av britene, og for å tillate skipet å bli forlatt for å begrense ytterligere tap. De fleste eksperter er enige om at kampskaden ville ha forårsaket henne å synke til slutt.

Gamle egyptiske tekster fra 2750 f.Kr. refererte til disse fiskene som \"Thunderer of the Nile\", og beskrev dem som \"beskyttere\" av alle andre fisk. Elektriske fisk ble igjen rapportert tusenvis av år senere av gamle greske, romerske og arabiske naturforskere og leger. Flere antikke forfattere, som Plinius den eldre og Scribonius Largus, bekreftet den følelsesløse effekten av elektriske sjokk levert av elektriske havkatter og elektriske stråler, og visste at slike sjokk kunne reise langs ledende gjenstander. Pasienter med sykdommer som gikt eller hodepine ble instruert til å berøre elektrisk fisk i håp om at den kraftige rystingen kunne kurere dem. Gamle kulturer rundt Middelhavet visste at visse gjenstander, som staver av rav, kunne gnides med kattens pels for å tiltrekke seg lette gjenstander som fjær. Thales fra Miletus gjorde en rekke observasjoner på statisk elektrisitet rundt 600 f.Kr., hvorfra han trodde at friksjon gjorde rav magnetisk, i motsetning til mineraler som magnetitt, som ikke trengte gnidning. Thales var feil i å tro at tiltrekningen var på grunn av en magnetisk effekt, men senere vitenskap ville bevise en sammenheng mellom magnetisme og elektrisitet. Ifølge en kontroversiell teori kan partene ha hatt kunnskap om galvanisering, basert på 1936 oppdagelsen av Bagdad-batteriet, som ligner en galvanisk celle, selv om det er usikkert om artefaktet var elektrisk i naturen. Elektrisitet ville forbli litt mer enn en intellektuell nysgjerrighet i årtusener frem til 1600, da den engelske vitenskapsmannen William Gilbert skrev De Magnete, der han gjorde en nøye studie av elektrisitet og magnetisme, og skilte lodestone-effekten fra statisk elektrisitet produsert ved å gni amber. Han skapte det nye latinske ordet electricus (\"av rav\" eller \"lignende rav\", elektron, det greske ordet for \"rav\") for å referere til egenskapen til å tiltrekke seg små gjenstander etter å ha blitt gnidd. Denne sammenhengen ga opphav til de engelske ordene \"electric\" og \"electricity\", som første gang dukket opp i trykt form i Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica fra 1646. Videre arbeid ble utført i det 17. og tidlig 18. århundre av Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray og C. F. du Fay. Senere på 1700-tallet gjennomførte Benjamin Franklin omfattende forskning i elektrisitet, og solgte sine eiendeler for å finansiere sitt arbeid. I juni 1752 er han kjent for å ha festet en metallnøkkel til bunnen av en fuktet drage streng og fløy dragen i en storm truet himmel. En rekke gnister hopper fra nøkkelen til baksiden av hånden hans viste at lynet var virkelig elektrisk i naturen. Han forklarte også den tilsynelatende paradoksale oppførselen til Leyden jar som en enhet for lagring av store mengder elektrisk ladning i form av elektrisitet som består av både positive og negative ladninger I 1775 rapporterte Hugh Williamson en rekke eksperimenter til Royal Society om støt fra elektrisk ål; samme år beskrev kirurgen og anatomen John Hunter strukturen til fiskens elektriske organer. I 1791 publiserte Luigi Galvani sin oppdagelse av bioelektromagnetikk, og demonstrerte at elektrisitet var mediet som nevroner overførte signaler til musklene. Alessandro Voltas batteri fra 1800, laget av vekslende lag av sink og kobber, ga forskerne en mer pålitelig kilde til elektrisk energi enn de elektrostatiske maskinene som ble brukt tidligere. Anerkjennelsen av elektromagnetisme, enhet av elektriske og magnetiske fenomener, skyldes Hans Christian Ørsted og André-Marie Ampère i 1819-1820. Michael Faraday oppfant den elektriske motoren i 1821, og Georg Ohm matematisk analysert den elektriske kretsen i 1827. Elektrisitet og magnetisme (og lys) ble definitivt knyttet sammen av James Clerk Maxwell, spesielt i hans \"On Physical Lines of Force\" i 1861 og 1862.  Mens det tidlige 19. århundre hadde sett rask fremgang i elektrisk vitenskap, ville det sene 19. århundre se den største framgangen i elektroteknikk. Gjennom folk som Alexander Graham Bell, Otto Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1. baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla og George Westinghouse, ble elektrisitet forvandlet fra en vitenskapelig nysgjerrighet til et viktig verktøy for det moderne liv. I 1887 oppdaget Heinrich Hertz at elektroder opplyst med ultrafiolett lys skaper elektriske gnistringer lettere. I 1905 publiserte Albert Einstein et papir som forklarte eksperimentelle data fra den fotoelektriske effekten som resultatet av lysenergi som ble båret i diskrete kvantepakker, energiserende elektroner. Denne oppdagelsen førte til kvanterevolusjonen. Einstein ble tildelt Nobelprisen i fysikk i 1921 for \"hans oppdagelse av loven om den fotoelektriske effekten\". Den fotoelektriske effekten er også brukt i fotoceller som kan bli funnet i solcellepaneler. Den første solid-state-enheten var \"kattenes-whisker detektor\" først brukt i 1900s i radio mottakere. En whisker-lignende ledning er plassert lett i kontakt med en fast krystall (for eksempel en germanium krystall) for å oppdage et radiosignal ved kontakt kryss effekt. I en solid-state komponent, er strømmen begrenset til faste elementer og forbindelser konstruert spesielt for å bytte og forsterke den. Strømstrømmen kan forstås i to former: som negativt ladede elektroner, og som positivt ladede elektronmangler kalt hull. Disse ladningene og hullene er forstått i form av kvantefysikk. Byggematerialet er oftest en krystallinsk halvleder. Solid-state elektronikk kom inn i sin egen med fremveksten av transistor teknologi. Den første fungerende transistoren, en germanium-basert punkt-kontakt transistor, ble oppfunnet av John Bardeen og Walter Houser Brattain ved Bell Labs i 1947, etterfulgt av bipolar krysset transistor i 1948.", "target": "Den første solid-state-enheten var \"kattenes-whisker detektor\" først brukt i 1900s i radio mottakere.

World Triathlon, USA Triathlon), samt for en individuell løpssted, er det noen grunnleggende universelle regler. Tradisjonelt er triathlon en individuell sport og hver utøver konkurrerer mot banen og klokken for den beste tiden. Som sådan, er idrettsutøvere ikke tillatt å motta hjelp fra noen andre utenfor løpet, med unntak av løp-sanksjonert hjelp frivillige som distribuerer mat og vann på banen.

Resultatene er vanligvis lagt ut på offisielle nettsteder og vil vise for hver triathlete hans / hennes svømme tid; syklustid (med overganger inkludert); løptid; og totaltid. Noen raser legger også inn overgangstider separat.  Andre regler for triatlon varierer fra løp til løp og innebærer generelt beskrivelser av tillatte utstyr (for eksempel er våtdrakter tillatt i USAT-arrangementer i svømmefasen av noen løp når vanntemperaturen er under 25,6 ° C (78,1 ° F)), og forbud mot forstyrrelse mellom idrettsutøvere. I tillegg er bruken av svømmefinner eller andre svømmefremdrifts- og svømmingshjelpemidler ulovlig i triatlon og kan resultere i diskvalifisering.  En regel som involverer sykkelbenet er at konkurrentens hjelm må være på før konkurrentene monterer (eller til og med tar besittelse av, i visse jurisdiksjoner) sykkelen, og den må forbli på til konkurrentene har avmontert; konkurrentene kan ikke kreves å bære hjelm når de ikke er på sykkelen (for eksempel mens de reparerer et mekanisk problem). Manglende overholdelse av denne regelen vil resultere i diskvalifisering. I tillegg skal alle sykler på sykkelbanen bare drives av menneskelig kraft og kraft. Bortsett fra å skyve en sykkel, er enhver fremdrivende handling forårsaket av bruk av hendene forbudt. Skulle en konkurrentes sykkel feile, kan de fortsette med løpet så lenge de gjør det med sykkelen i slepe. Det er også strenge regler om \"sykkelmontering\". Konkurrenter kan ikke begynne å sykle ut av overgang før de er over en tydelig markert linje. Å montere sykkelen før dette kan medføre en straff (eksempel: en 15-sekunders tidstraff ved OL i London 2012 ble pålagt Jonathan Brownlee, en konkurrent fra Storbritannia, for å montere sykkelen for tidlig.)

For det første, romantikerne, spesielt Victor Hugo. Senere, og på en avgjørende måte, ble Darío påvirket av parnassianerne: Théophile Gautier, Catulle Mendès og José María de Heredia. En annen avgjørende innflytelse var prosaskriveren og poeten og Cubas nasjonalhelt, Jose Martí. Det endelige definerende elementet av Darianian estetikk er hans beundring mot symbolistene, spesielt Paul Verlaine. Ved å oppsummere sin egen poetiske bane i det innledende diktet til Cantos de vida y esperanza (1905) syntetiserte Darío selv sine viktigste påvirkninger da han bekrefter at han var \"sterk med Hugo og tvetydig med Verlaine\" (\"con Hugo fuerte y con Verlaine ambiguo\".)  I avsnittet \"Palabras Liminares\" av Prosas Profanas (1896) hadde han allerede skrevet et avsnitt som avslører betydningen av fransk kultur i utviklingen av sitt litterære arbeid:  Den gamle spanjolen med det hvite skjegget peker mot en rekke berømte portretter: \"Denne - sier han - er den store Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, enhånds geni; denne er Lope de Vega, denne er Garcilaso, denne er Quintana\". Jeg ber ham om den edle mannen Gracián, for Teresa av Ávila, for den modige Góngora og den sterkeste av alle, Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas. Så sier jeg: \"Shakespeare! Dante! -Hva er det? Hugo...! (og i hodet mitt: Verlaine...!) \" Så, når du sier farvel: \"-Gamle mann, det er viktig å si: min kone er fra mitt land; min elskerinne er fra Paris\".  Los raros er et illustrativt volum om litterære smaker, som han publiserte på samme år som Prosas profanas, og dedikert til kort glosing noen av forfatterne og intellektuelle mot hvem han følte dyp beundring. Blant dem i boken finner vi Edgar Allan Poe, Villiers de l'Isle Adam, Léon Bloy, Paul Verlaine, Lautréamont, Eugénio de Castro og José Martí (den siste er den eneste nevnte som skrev sitt litterære arbeid på spansk). Den franske kulturens dominans er mer enn åpenbar. Darío skrev: \"Modernisme er ikke noe annet enn spansk vers og prosa som er gjennomgått gjennom det fine feilet av god fransk vers og god fransk prosa\". Ved å legge til side sin innledende fase, før Azul..., hvor hans poesi skylder mye til de store navnene på spansk poesi fra 1800-tallet, som Núñez de Arce og Campoamor, var Darío en stor beundrer av Bécquer. Spanske temaer er godt representert i hans arbeid, allerede i Prosas profanas og spesielt etter hans andre tur til Spania i 1899. Bevisst om samtidens spanske dekadens i politikk og kunst (en bekymring han delte med den såkalte generasjonen av '98), ble han ofte inspirert av figurer og elementer fra fortiden. Når det gjelder forfattere på andre språk, er det verdt å nevne at han følte en dyp beundring for tre forfattere fra USA: Ralph Waldo Emerson, Edgar Allan Poe og Walt Whitman.

Ideen om at husplanter har en merkbar effekt på innendørs luftkvalitet er i stor grad basert på Clean Air Study utført av NASA på 1980-tallet. Studien testet planter i forseglede kamre og med svært høye nivåer av flyktige organiske forbindelser (spesielt benzen, trikloretylen og formaldehyd). Det konkluderte med at i den grad som husplanter forbedrer luftkvaliteten, er virkningsmekanismen mikroorganismer i pottemulten, snarere enn plantene selv.  Husplanter har en statistisk signifikant effekt på konsentrasjonene av både karbonmonoksid og karbondioksid i normale innendørsmiljøer, og reduserer karbondioksidnivåene med 10-25% og karbonmonoksidnivåene med opptil 90%.

{"model_name": "wenge-research/yayi-7b", "input": "Sammendrag av NATOs historie\nContext:Traktaten i Dunkirk ble undertegnet av Frankrike og Storbritannia den 4. mars 1947, i etterkant av andre verdenskrig og begynnelsen av den kalde krigen, som en traktat om allians og gjensidig bistand i tilfelle mulige angrep fra Tyskland eller Sovjetunionen. I mars 1948 ble denne alliansen utvidet i Brussel-traktaten for å inkludere Benelux-landene, og dannet Bryssel-traktatorganisasjonen, kjent som Western Union. Samtaler for en bredere militær allianse, som kunne inkludere Nord-Amerika, begynte også den måneden i USA, hvor deres utenrikspolitikk under Truman-doktrinen fremmet internasjonal solidaritet mot handlinger de så på som kommunistisk aggresjon, som statskuppet i Tsjekkoslovakia i februar 1948. Disse samtalene resulterte i undertegnelsen av den nordatlantiske traktaten den 4. april 1949 av medlemslandene i Western Union pluss USA, Canada, Portugal, Italia, Norge, Danmark og Island. Den kanadiske diplomaten Lester B. Pearson var en viktig forfatter og utarbeider av traktaten.  Et langt rektangulært rom med flere rader av sittende individer på hver side, og flagg som henger på den andre enden. Vest-Tyskland ble med i NATO i 1955, noe som førte til dannelsen av rivaliserende Warszawa-pakten under den kalde krigen. Den nordatlantiske traktaten var i stor grad sovende til Korea-krigen initierte etableringen av NATO for å implementere den med en integrert militær struktur. Dette inkluderte dannelsen av Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) i 1951, som adopterte mange av Western Union militære strukturer og planer, inkludert deres avtaler om standardisering av utstyr og avtaler om stasjonering av utenlandske militære styrker i europeiske land. I 1952 ble stillingen som generalsekretær i NATO etablert som organisasjonens øverste sivile. Det året var også den første store maritime NATO-øvelsen, øvelsen Mainbrace og tiltredelsen av Hellas og Tyrkia til organisasjonen. Etter London- og Paris-konferansene fikk Vest-Tyskland tillatelse til å gjenoppbygge militæret, da de sluttet seg til NATO i mai 1955, noe som igjen var en viktig faktor i opprettelsen av den sovjetisk-dominerte Warszawa-pakten, som skilte de to motsatte sidene i den kalde krigen.  Byggingen av Berlinmuren i 1961 markerte en høydepunkt i den kalde krigens spenninger, da 400.000 amerikanske tropper var stasjonert i Europa. Tvilen på styrken av forholdet mellom de europeiske statene og USA ebbet og flommet, sammen med tvil om troverdigheten til NATOs forsvar mot en potensiell sovjetisk invasjon - tvil som førte til utviklingen av den uavhengige franske kjernefysiske avskrekkingen og tilbaketrekkingen av Frankrike fra NATOs militære struktur i 1966. I 1982 ble det nydemokratiske Spania med i alliansen.  Revolusjonene i 1989 i Europa førte til en strategisk reevaluering av NATOs formål, natur, oppgaver og fokus på kontinentet. I oktober 1990 ble Øst-Tyskland en del av Forbundsrepublikken Tyskland og alliansen, og i november 1990 signerte alliansen traktaten om konvensjonelle væpnede styrker i Europa (CFE) i Paris med Sovjetunionen. Det påla spesifikke militære reduksjoner over hele kontinentet, som fortsatte etter kollapsen av Warszawapakten i februar 1991 og oppløsningen av Sovjetunionen i desember, som fjernet de facto hovedmotstandere av NATO. Dette startet en nedtrekking av militære utgifter og utstyr i Europa. CFE-traktaten tillot signatarene å fjerne 52.000 stykker konvensjonelle våpen i de følgende seksten årene, og tillot militære utgifter av NATOs europeiske medlemmer å falle med 28 prosent fra 1990 til 2015. I 1990 ble forsikringer gitt av flere vestlige ledere til Mikhail Gorbatsjov om at NATO ikke ville utvide seg lenger øst, som avslørt av notater fra private samtaler. Imidlertid inneholdt den endelige teksten til traktaten om den endelige oppgjøret med hensyn til Tyskland, som ble undertegnet senere samme år, ingen omtale av spørsmålet om østlig utvidelse.  To høye betongseksjoner av en vegg i en gressplåt foran en buet bygning med blå-glass vinduer. Berlinmurens fall i 1989 markerte et vendepunkt i NATOs rolle i Europa, og denne delen av muren er nå vist utenfor NATOs hovedkvarter. På 1990-tallet utvidet organisasjonen sine aktiviteter til politiske og humanitære situasjoner som tidligere ikke hadde vært NATO-anliggender. Under oppløsningen av Jugoslavia gjennomførte organisasjonen sine første militære intervensjoner i Bosnia fra 1992 til 1995 og senere Jugoslavia i 1999. Disse konfliktene motiverte en stor militær restrukturering etter den kalde krigen. NATOs militære struktur ble kuttet ned og reorganisert, med nye krefter som hovedkvarteret Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps etablert.  Politisk søkte organisasjonen bedre relasjoner med de nyutdannede autonome statene i Sentral- og Øst-Europa, og diplomatiske fora for regionalt samarbeid mellom NATO og naboene ble opprettet i denne perioden etter den kalde krigen, inkludert partnerskapet for fred og Middelhavsdialoginitiativet i 1994, Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council i 1997 og NATO-Russland Permanent Joint Council i 1998. På toppmøtet i Washington i 1999 ble Ungarn, Polen og Tsjekkia offisielt medlem av NATO, og organisasjonen utstedte også nye retningslinjer for medlemskap med individuelle \"medlemskapshandlingsplaner\". Disse planene styrte den påfølgende tillegget av nye alliansemedlemmer. Valget av den franske presidenten Nicolas Sarkozy i 2007 førte til en stor reform av Frankrikes militære posisjon, som kulminerte med tilbake til fullt medlemskap den 4. april 2009, som også inkluderte Frankrike gjenforenes NATO Military Command Structure, samtidig som en uavhengig kjernefysisk avskrekkende.  Artikkel 5 i den nordatlantiske traktaten, som krever at medlemslandene skal komme til hjelp for enhver medlemsstat som er utsatt for et væpnet angrep, ble påkalt for første og eneste gang etter 11. september-angrepene, etter hvilke tropper ble utplassert til Afghanistan under NATO-ledede ISAF. Organisasjonen har operert en rekke andre roller siden da, inkludert å sende trenere til Irak, bistå i anti-piratvirksomhet, og i 2011 håndheve en flyforbudssone over Libya i samsvar med FNs sikkerhetsråds resolusjon 1973.  Russlands anneksjon av Krim førte til sterk fordømmelse av alle NATO-medlemmer, og var en av de syv gangene at artikkel 4, som krever konsultasjon mellom NATO-medlemmer, har blitt påkalt. Tidligere ganger inkludert under Irak-krigen og den syriske borgerkrigen. På toppmøtet i Wales i 2014 forpliktet lederne av NATOs medlemsland seg formelt for første gang til å bruke tilsvarende minst to prosent av bruttonasjonalproduktet på forsvar innen 2024, noe som tidligere bare hadde vært en uformell retningslinje. På toppmøtet i Warszawa i 2016 ble NATO-landene enige om opprettelsen av NATO Enhanced Forward Presence, som utplasserte fire multinasjonelle bataljonsstørrelse slaggrupper i Estland, Latvia, Litauen og Polen. Før og under den russiske invasjonen av Ukraina i 2022, sendte flere NATO-land landtropper, krigsskip og kampfly for å forsterke alliansens østlige flanke, og flere land påkalte igjen artikkel 4. I mars 2022 møttes NATO-ledere i Brussel for et ekstraordinært toppmøte som også involverte G7- og EU-ledere. NATO-medlemsstater ble enige om å etablere fire ekstra slaggrupper i Bulgaria, Ungarn, Romania og Slovakia, og elementer av NATO Response Force ble aktivert for første gang i NATOs historie.  I juni 2022 hadde NATO utplassert 40.000 soldater langs sin 2500 kilometer lange østlige flanke for å avskrekke russisk aggresjon. Mer enn halvparten av dette antallet har blitt utplassert i Bulgaria, Romania, Ungarn, Slovakia og Polen, som fem land samler en betydelig kombinert tidligere NATO-styrke på 259.000 soldater.

{"model_name": "wenge-research/yayi-7b", "input": "hva er forstenet tre\nContext:Petrifisert tre, også kjent som petrifisert tre (fra gammel gresk πέτρα som betyr 'rock' eller'stein'; bokstavelig talt 'treet ble til stein'), er navnet gitt til en spesiell type fossilisert tre, fossiliserte rester av terrestrisk vegetasjon. Petrifikasjon er resultatet av at et tre eller trelignende planter er erstattet av stein via en mineraliseringsprosess som ofte inkluderer permineralisering og erstatning. De organiske materialene som utgjør celleveggene har blitt replikert med mineraler (hovedsakelig silisium i form av opal, kalkedon eller kvarts). I noen tilfeller kan den opprinnelige strukturen av stamvevet delvis bevares. I motsetning til andre plantefossiler, som vanligvis er inntrykk eller kompresjoner, er forstenet tre en tredimensjonal representasjon av det opprinnelige organiske materialet.  Petrifikasjonsprosessen skjer under bakken, når tre blir begravet i vann eller vulkansk aske. Tilstedeværelsen av vann reduserer tilgjengeligheten av oksygen som hemmer aerob nedbrytning av bakterier og sopp. Mineral-belastet vann som strømmer gjennom sedimentene kan føre til permineralisering, som oppstår når mineraler utfelle fra løsningen fyller interiøret av celler og andre tomme rom. Under utskifting fungerer plantens cellevegger som en mal for mineralisering. Det må være en balanse mellom nedbrytning av cellulose og lignin og mineral template for cellulære detaljer å bli bevart med troskap. Mesteparten av det organiske stoffet brytes ofte ned, men noe av ligninet kan forbli. Silika i form av opal-A, kan inkruste og permeere tre relativt raskt i varme kilder. Men forstenet tre er oftest assosiert med trær som ble begravet i fint kornet sediment av deltaer og flomområder eller vulkanske laharer og aske senger.

{"model_name": "wenge-research/yayi-7b", "input": "Beskriv den kvantitative lempelsen i 3 punkter eller mindre.\nContext:Kvantitativ lettelse (QE) er en pengepolitisk handling der en sentralbank kjøper forhåndsbestemte mengder statsobligasjoner eller andre finansielle eiendeler for å stimulere økonomisk aktivitet. Kvantitativ lettelse er en ny form for pengepolitikk som ble brukt bredt etter finanskrisen i 2007-2008. Det er ment å redusere en økonomisk resesjon når inflasjonen er svært lav eller negativ, noe som gjør standard pengepolitikk ineffektiv. Kvantitativ innstramming (QT) gjør det motsatte, der en sentralbank av pengepolitiske grunner selger en del av sine beholdninger av statsobligasjoner eller andre finansielle eiendeler.  I likhet med konvensjonelle markedsoperasjoner som brukes til å gjennomføre pengepolitikken, gjennomfører en sentralbank kvantitativ lempelse ved å kjøpe finansielle eiendeler fra kommersielle banker og andre finansinstitusjoner, og dermed øke prisene på disse finansielle eiendelene og senke avkastningen, samtidig som pengemengden økes. I motsetning til normal politikk innebærer kvantitativ lempelse imidlertid vanligvis kjøp av mer risikable eller langsiktige eiendeler (i stedet for kortsiktige statsobligasjoner) i forhåndsbestemte beløp i stor skala, over en forhåndsforpliktet tidsperiode.  Sentralbanker benytter vanligvis kvantitative lettelser når deres nominelle rentesatsmål nærmer seg eller når null. Svært lave renter fører til en likviditetsfelle, en situasjon der folk foretrekker å holde kontanter eller svært likvide eiendeler, gitt de lave avkastningene på andre finansielle eiendeler. Dette gjør det vanskelig for renten å gå under null; pengepolitiske myndigheter kan da bruke kvantitative lettelser for å stimulere økonomien ytterligere i stedet for å prøve å senke renten ytterligere.  Kvantitativ lettelse kan bidra til å bringe økonomien ut av resesjon og bidra til å sikre at inflasjonen ikke faller under sentralbankens inflasjonsmål. Imidlertid er QE-programmer også kritisert for sine bivirkninger og risikoer, som inkluderer at politikken er mer effektiv enn planlagt i å handle mot deflasjon (som fører til høyere inflasjon på lengre sikt), eller ikke er effektiv nok hvis bankene forblir motvillige til å låne og potensielle låntakere er uvillige til å låne. Kvantitativ lettelse har også blitt kritisert for å øke prisene på finansielle eiendeler, noe som bidrar til ulikhet.

Ordet laser er et akronym som oppsto som et akronym for lysforsterkning ved stimulert stråling. Den første laseren ble bygget i 1960 av Theodore Maiman ved Hughes Research Laboratories, basert på teoretisk arbeid av Charles H. Townes og Arthur Leonard Schawlow.  En laser skiller seg fra andre lyskilder ved at den sender ut lys som er kohærent. Romlig koherens gjør det mulig å fokusere en laser på et stramt sted, noe som muliggjør applikasjoner som laserskjæring og litografi. Romlig koherens gjør også at en laserstråle kan holde seg smal over store avstander (kollimering), noe som muliggjør applikasjoner som laserpekere og lidar (lysdeteksjon og avstand). Lasere kan også ha høy tidskoherens, noe som gjør at de kan avgi lys med et veldig smal spektrum. Alternativt kan tidskoherens brukes til å produsere ultrakorte lyspulser med et bredt spekter, men varighet så kort som femtosekund.  Lasere brukes i optiske disk-stasjoner, laserprintere, strekkode skannere, DNA-sekvenseringsinstrumenter, fiberoptisk og fri-rom optisk kommunikasjon, halvleder chip produksjon (fotolitografi), laser kirurgi og hudbehandlinger, skjæring og sveising materialer, militære og rettshåndhevelse enheter for merking mål og måle rekkevidde og hastighet, og i laser belysning skjermer for underholdning. Halvlederlasere i blått til nær-UV har også blitt brukt i stedet for lysdioder (LED) for å stimulere fluorescens som en hvit lyskilde.

{"model_name": "wenge-research/yayi-7b", "input": "Hva er fordelene med arbeidsdeling?\nContext:Arbeidsdeling er å skille oppgavene i et økonomisk system eller en organisasjon slik at deltakerne kan spesialisere seg (spesialisering). Individer, organisasjoner og nasjoner er utstyrt med eller tilegne seg spesialiserte evner, og enten danne kombinasjoner eller handel for å dra nytte av andres evner i tillegg til sine egne. Spesialiserte kapasiteter kan omfatte utstyr eller naturressurser samt ferdigheter. Opplæring og kombinasjoner av utstyr og andre ressurser som fungerer sammen, er ofte viktige. For eksempel kan en person spesialisere seg ved å skaffe seg verktøy og ferdighetene til å bruke dem effektivt, akkurat som en organisasjon kan spesialisere seg ved å skaffe seg spesialisert utstyr og ansette eller trene dyktige operatører. Arbeidsdeling er motivet for handel og kilden til økonomisk gjensidig avhengighet.  Historisk sett er en økende arbeidsdeling assosiert med veksten i total produksjon og handel, kapitalismens fremvekst og den økende kompleksiteten i industrialiserte prosesser. Begrepet og gjennomføringen av arbeidsdeling har blitt observert i gammel sumerisk (mesopotamisk) kultur, hvor tildeling av jobber i noen byer sammenfalt med en økning i handel og økonomisk gjensidig avhengighet. Arbeidsdeling øker også generelt både produsentens og den enkelte arbeidstakers produktivitet.  Etter den neolittiske revolusjonen førte pastoralisme og landbruk til mer pålitelige og rikelige matforsyninger, noe som økte befolkningen og førte til spesialisering av arbeid, inkludert nye klasser av håndverkere, krigere og utvikling av eliter. Denne spesialiseringen ble videreført av industrialiseringsprosessen, og industriell revolusjon-era fabrikker. Følgelig var mange klassiske økonomer så vel som noen mekaniske ingeniører, som Charles Babbage, talsmenn for arbeidsdeling.

Det er det største av fire land som utgjør Kongeriket Nederland. Nederland består av tolv provinser; det grenser mot Tyskland i øst, og Belgia i sør, med en Nordsjøkystlinje i nord og vest. Det deler maritime grenser med Storbritannia, Tyskland og Belgia i Nordsjøen. Landets offisielle språk er nederlandsk, med vestfrisian som et sekundært offisielt språk i provinsen Friesland. Nederlandsk, engelsk og papiamento er offisielle i de karibiske territoriene.   De fire største byene i Nederland er Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Haag og Utrecht. Amsterdam er landets mest folkerike by og den nominelle hovedstaden. Haag har sete for generalstatene, kabinettet og Høyesterett. Rotterdam havn er den travleste havnen i Europa. Schiphol er den travleste flyplassen i Nederland, og den tredje travleste i Europa. Nederland er et grunnleggermedlem av Den europeiske union, euroområdet, G10, NATO, OECD og WTO, samt en del av Schengen-området og den trilaterale Benelux-unionen. Det er vertskap for flere mellomstatlige organisasjoner og internasjonale domstoler, hvorav mange er sentrert i Haag.   Nederland betyr bokstavelig talt \"lavere land\" i referanse til sin lave høyde og flate topografi, med nesten 26% faller under havnivå. De fleste av områdene under havnivå, kjent som polder, er resultatet av landreklamering som begynte i det 14. århundre. I den republikanske perioden, som begynte i 1588, gikk Nederland inn i en unik epoke av politisk, økonomisk og kulturell storhet, rangert blant de mektigste og innflytelsesrike i Europa og verden; denne perioden er kjent som den nederlandske gullalderen. I løpet av denne tiden etablerte sine handelsselskaper, det nederlandske ostindiske selskap og det nederlandske vestindiske selskap, kolonier og handelssteder over hele verden.   Med en befolkning på 17,8 millioner mennesker, som alle bor innenfor et totalt areal på 41,850 km2 (16,160 sq mi) - hvorav landområdet er 33,500 km2 (12,900 sq mi) - Nederland er det 16. tettest befolkede landet i verden og det nest tettest befolkede landet i Den europeiske union, med en tetthet på 531 mennesker per kvadratkilometer (1,380 mennesker / sq mi). Likevel er det verdens nest største eksportør av mat og landbruksprodukter etter verdi, takket være sin fruktbare jord, mildt klima, intensivt landbruk og oppfinnsomhet.   Nederland har vært et parlamentarisk konstitusjonelt monarki med en enhetlig struktur siden 1848.

Noen bruker dem til og med til å vokte sine mindre slektninger, alpakene. De brukes oftest i de vestlige områdene av USA, hvor større rovdyr, som coyotes og ville hunder, er utbredt. Vanligvis brukes en enkelt gelding (kastrert hann).  Forskning tyder på at bruken av flere vaktslamaer ikke er like effektiv som en. Flere hanner har en tendens til å knytte seg til hverandre, snarere enn med husdyret, og kan ignorere flokken. En to år gammel, galde hanne binder seg tett til sine nye offer og er instinktivt svært effektiv i å forhindre rovdyr. Noen lamaer ser ut til å knytte seg raskere til sauer eller geiter hvis de blir introdusert like før lammet. Mange får- og geitprodusenter indikerer at et spesielt bånd raskt utvikler seg mellom lammene og deres vokterlama, og lamaen er spesielt beskyttende for lammene.  Å bruke lamaer som vakter har redusert tapene til rovdyr for mange produsenter. Verdien av husdyret som spares hvert år, overstiger kostnaden for å kjøpe og vedlikeholde en lama hvert år. Selv om ikke alle lamaer er egnet til jobben, er de fleste et levedyktig, ikke-dødelig alternativ for å redusere rovdyret, og krever ingen trening og lite omsorg.", "target": "TLDR: LLamas kan brukes som husdyrvakter.
