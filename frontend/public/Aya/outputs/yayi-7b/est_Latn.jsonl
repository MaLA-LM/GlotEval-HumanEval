Õlle maitseprofiili moodustavad mitmed tegurid ja osa oma õlle kodus valmistamise naudingust on see, et saate mängida igaühega, et muuta oma homebrew õlle maitse ja iseloomu. Siin on viis võimalust, kuidas muuta oma kodus valmistatud õlle retsepti, et lisada huvitavaid maitseid, või alternatiivina saate muuta olemasolevat kodus valmistatud õlle retsepti, mida jagatakse kellegi teise või õlletehasega.  1. Kasutage erinevaid humale. Koduse õllevalmistuse jaoks on saadaval väga palju erinevaid humale, millest igaüks võib tuua oma erilise maitse ja aroomi teie õllele, alates ananassist ja aprikoosidest kuni männipuudeni ja metsa, greipfruuti ja sidrunipeeneni. Kasutades oma retsepti erinevat humalat kas samast või täiesti erinevast humalaperekonnast, saate hõlpsasti lisada oma õlle maitseprofiilile huvitavaid ja sageli radikaalseid muudatusi. Kuid sõltuvalt sellest, millal õllevalmistamisprotsessi käigus humalat lisatakse, võib õlle kibedust suurendada või vähendada, sest erinevatel humala sordidel on erinev alfahapete sisaldus.  Teine. Kasuta teist pärmikut. Lisaks õlle kääritamisele jätavad pärmid maha palju huvitavaid maitseid ja võivad anda teie koduse õllele oma peenese iseloomu. Näiteks Inglise pärmi tüved võivad lisada õllega ja magusa maitse, California pärm kipub looma puhta ja terava õlle, samal ajal kui hooaja pärm lisab õllele heled ja puuviljase maitse.  Kolmas. Kasutage erinevaid teravilju Kui muuta aluspiimade kogust, võib õlle alkohoolisus kas suureneda või langeda. Üritan vahetada ühe alus malti teise vastu, nagu Ameerika kahvatud maltid Briti sordi vastu, ja otsin nende vahelisi peeneid erinevusi. Võite ka mängida eritootega, näiteks kasutada pisut tumedamat rösti.  4. Lisage puuviljad, vürtsid või ravimtaimed Puuviljad, vürtsid, ravimtaimed ja muud koostisosad on suurepärane võimalus lisada oma koduse õllele täiesti isiklikku iseloomu. Kõik värskest maasikast ja basiilikast kuni vanilli ja kardamooni saab täiendada teisi õlle maitsvaid, humalasid maitseid.  Viis. Muuda vee profiili Erinevad õlle stiilid on tavaliselt kõige parem saavutada sobiva veeprofiiliga, erinevate mineraalide tasemega, et saavutada soovitud maitseprofiil. Õlle võib valmistada täisterasvamaks, magusamaks, kuivamaks, kibedamaks või isegi hapukamaks, kui õlle valmistamise vees sisalduvate mineraalide kogust kohandatakse.", "output": ""}

The high yield is when the yield is greater than 50%, the low yield is when the yield is less than 50%. The main difference between these two is that the high yield is a process where the yield is greater than 50%, while the low yield is a process where the yield is less than 50%. These processes are usually used in the chemical industry. Selgita, also called the Kell-Töötab process, is a process where a mixture of benzene and ammonia is heated to form a solution containing a mixture of benzene and ammonia.

Kas soovite traditsioonilist põlemismootorit või elektrilist? Kui valida sisepõlemismootor, siis mitu silindrit valida? Vähem silindreid on tavaliselt odavamad, muudavad mootorratta kergemaks ja seega lihtsamaks manööverdamiseks. Rohkem silindreid muudab mootori pehmemaks, annab ka rohkem võimsust, kuid on raskemad ja kallimad. - Milleks seda kasutatakse? Lihtsalt lõbu pärast, tööle minek, üldine transport? Reisimine? Offroad'i? Võidusõit? - Abi süsteemid: kaasaegsetel mootorrattadel on mitmesugused abi süsteemid, nagu ABS, kiiruskontrolli, kaugusandurid, elektroonilised sõidumeetodid erinevate ilmastikutingimuste korral jne. Need võivad muuta sõidu ohutumaks, kuid lisavad ka kaalu ja muudavad ratta kallimaks. Milliseid sul vaja on? - Stiil: on olemas erinevad stiilid nagu alasti jalgrattasõit, kruiser, kopter, dual sport, võidusõit, scrambler jne. Erinevad stiilid võivad olla enam-vähem sobivad sõltuvalt teie kasutamisest või võite lihtsalt valida selle, mis teile meeldib. - Suurus: suuruse osas on kaks kõige tähtsamat aspekti istme kõrgus ja kaal. Mõlemad mõjutavad oluliselt seda, kui hästi sa oled juhtimisel, kui sa ei sõida, näiteks kui sul on vaja peatada liiklusvalgustusel või minna aeglaselt liikluses. Istme kõrgus on oluline, et jalgad saaksid peatusel maapinna kätte. Siiski mängivad siin rolli ka istme laius ja jalgratta üldised laiuse mõõtmed.

Idabloki satelliitriikides võeti kasutusele sõltuvad kommunistlikud valitsused. Pärast seda, kui Nõukogude Liit oli saanud maailmas teiseks tuumajõuks, asutas ta Varssavi pakti ja astus võitlusesse globaalse domineerimise nimel, mida tuntakse kui külma sõda, konkureerivate Ameerika Ühendriikide ja NATOga. Pärast Stalini surma 1953. aastal ja lühikest kollektiivvalitsemise perioodi hukkas uus juht Nikita Hruštšov Stalini ja käivitas de-staliniseerimise poliitika, vabastades paljud poliitvangid Gulagi töölaagritest. Repressiivse poliitika üldine leevendamine sai hiljem nimeks Hruštšovi sulatus. Samal ajal jõudsid külma sõja pinged oma tipptasemele, kui kaks rivaali põrkasid kokku Ameerika Ühendriikide Jupiteri rakettide paigutamise pärast Türgis ja Nõukogude rakettide paigutamise pärast Kuubal.  Aastal 1957 käivitas Nõukogude Liit maailma esimese tehisliku satelliidi Sputnik 1, alustades sellega kosmoseajast. Vene kosmonaut Jüri Gagarin sai esimeseks inimeseks, kes orbiidil Maa, pardal Vostok 1 mehitatud kosmoselaev 12. aprillil 1961. Pärast Hruštšovi vallandamist 1964. aastal järgnes järjekordne kollektiivvalitsuse periood, kuni Leonid Brejnev sai juhiks. 1970. aastate ja 1980. aastate alguse ajastu nimetati hiljem stagnatsiooni ajastuks. 1965. aasta Kossigini reformi eesmärk oli Nõukogude majanduse osaline detsentraliseerimine. 1979. aastal, pärast kommunistide juhitud revolutsiooni Afganistanis, tungisid Nõukogude väed riiki, alustades lõpuks Nõukogude-Afgaanistani sõda. 1988. aasta mais hakkasid Nõukogude Liidu väed Afganistanist lahkuma, kuna rahvusvaheline opositsioon, püsiv Nõukogude-vastane gerillasõda ja Nõukogude Liidu kodanike toetuse puudumine.

See viis aga tugevate natsionalistlike ja separatistlike liikumiste tõusule kogu riigis. Enne 1991. aastat oli Nõukogude majandus maailma suuruselt teine, kuid selle viimastel aastatel sattus see kriisi.  1991. aastaks hakkasid majanduslikud ja poliitilised segadused üle keema, kui Balti riigid otsustasid Nõukogude Liidust lahkuda. 17. märtsil toimus rahvahääletus, kus osalevate kodanike valdav enamus hääletas Nõukogude Liidu muutmise heaks uueks föderaalseks liiduks. 1991. aasta juunis sai Boris Jeltsin esimeseks otsevalitud presidendiks Venemaa ajaloos, kui ta valiti Venemaa SFSRi presidendiks. 1991. aasta augustis viis Gorbatšovi valitsuse liikmete riigipöördekats, mis oli suunatud Gorbatšovi vastu ja mille eesmärk oli säilitada Nõukogude Liit, selle asemel Nõukogude Liidu Kommunistliku Partei lõpule. 25. detsembril 1991, pärast Nõukogude Liidu lagunemist, tekkis koos tänapäeva Venemaaga veel neljateistkümmend post-nõukogude riiki.", "target": "Nõukogude Liit taganes Nõukogude-Afgaanistani sõjast, mis algas 1988. aasta mais, tänu rahvusvahelisele vastupanu, püsivale Nõukogude-vastasele gerillasõjale ja Nõukogude kodanike toetuse puudumisele.", "output": "\"\nThe Soviet Union had a nuclear missile program, which was cancelled after the fall of the Soviet Union.

Ma olen sellele palju mõelnud ja teinud palju uuringuid, mis sellega seotud võib olla. Ma olen teadlik, et lemmiklooma omamine on suur pühendumus, nii et ma kirjutan sulle, et selgitada, miks ma arvan, et sa peaksid mulle lemmiklooma kilpkonna ostma ja miks kilpkonn on fantastiline lemmiklooma valik.  Koerkilpkonna eest hoolitsemine annab mulle tugeva vastutuse. Ma tean, et pean hoolitsema selle eest, et mu kilpkonnal oleks piisavalt toitu, et tal oleks õige temperatuur, et tal oleks võimalus soojendatud lambi all või päikese käes, kui see on piisavalt soe. Ma olen väga nõus andma aega ja pühendumist, mis on vajalik minu kilpkonna eest hoolitsemiseks. Kilpkonn on minu ainuvastutus ja ma tunnen ennast piisavalt täiskasvanuks, et pühenduda selle hoole ja õnnele.  Nagu sa tead, kannatan ma ärevuse all ja kool teeb mind mõnikord eriti mures. Paljud uuringud on näidanud, et lemmikloomad vähendavad inimeste ärevust ja stressi. Ma olen kindel, et kilpkonna omamine on fantastiline eemalejuhtimine mu muredest ja toob mulle suurt naudingut. Vastupidiselt üldlevinud arvamusele armastavad kilpkonnad, et nende koorikut ja lõua kiilastaks. Ja ma arvan, et mulle oleks väga lõõgastav kilpkonnat hellitada, kui ma koolist koju jõuan.  Kilpkonnad on väga enesekindlad. Kui neile antakse soe koht, kus soojendada, ligipääs värskele veele ja palju värsket toitu, nagu punapea, kapsas, salat ja muud leheküljelised köögiviljad, on nad väga õnnelikud, kui nad jäetakse omaendale. Kuna me elame Ühendkuningriigis, kus temperatuurid võivad olla jahedad, peaksime ostma kilpkonnalaua, millel on hea alus, päikesepaiste lamp ja mõned nahad, kus kilpkonn võib end ära peituda. Meil on köögis selle jaoks piisavalt ruumi. Kui on soe, võib kilpkonn minna meie aias kinni hoitud kohta. Kilpkonna laud ja lamp maksavad umbes 200 naela, aga see on alles esialgne kulu. Seejärel on kilpkonna hoidmine väga odav. Tegelikult saate enamuse nende toidust tasuta välja korjata, mida ma rõõmuga teen, kui me läheme perega jalutama.  Vastupidiselt levinud arvamusele võivad kilpkonnad olla väga sõbralikud. Nagu ma juba eespool mainisin, armastavad nad, kui neid kiusatakse, kuid kas sa teadsid ka seda, et nad tunnevad oma peremeest ära ja mõned võivad isegi reageerida nende nimele? Uuring näitas, et kilpkonnad suudavad ära tunda oma eelmised omanikud, keda nad pole aastaid näinud, nii et nad on nii sõbralikud kui ka väga intelligentsed. Sa võid muretseda kilpkonna talveunest, aga ma olen selle kohta palju uurimistööd teinud ja tean nüüd täpselt, mida teha. Kui me ostame kilpkonna, siis peab ta talveunest maksimaalselt kolm kuud alates septembri lõpust. Me peame oma kilpkonna talveuneks hästi isoleeritud kasti panema. Temperatuur ei tohi olla üle ega allpool 5 kraadi Celsiust ja meie garaaž oleks selleks ideaalne koht. Meil on seal temperatuurimõõtur, nii et ma saan hoida silma peal soojuse taset.  Lõpuks olen ma vaadanud kilpkonna ostmise hinda. Soovitan osta paar aastat vana kilpkonna, sest see vajab vähem hoolt. Me saame osta eel-armastatud kilpkonna, millele on mikroküps pandud, umbes 100 naela eest. Ja kui me puhkusele läheme, olen leidnud kilpkonna hotelli, mida juhib veterinaar ja see maksab vaid 60 naela 10 päeva viibimiseks.  Ma arvan, et te olete nõus, et ma olen läbi viinud väga põhjalikke uuringuid kilpkonna eest hoolitsemise kohta ja ma loodan, et te olete nõus, et ma olen nüüd piisavalt küps, et hoolitseda lemmiklooma eest. Usun siiralt, et lemmikkilpkonn annab mulle tugeva vastutuse tunnet ja mõjutab mu meeleolu positiivselt. Ma arvan, et kogu perele meeldib kilpkonn. Nad on sõbralikud, armastavad, huvitavad ja intelligentsed loomad ja meil kõigil on neist kasu.  Oleksin tänulik, kui te mu palvet täielikult arvesse võtaksite.  Palju armastust.

Vastuse väljatöötamiseks tuleb kõigepealt mõista viirust ja selle levikut ning seejärel arutada arutelu poliitilisest, eetilisest, sotsiaalsest ja majanduslikust perspektiivist. Esimene SARS-CoV-2 juhtum, mis põhjustab COVID-19 haigust, registreeriti 31. detsembril 2019 (\"Koronaviiruse haigus\", 2022), ja see põhjustas üle maailma poliitilise ebastabiilsuse ahelreaktsiooni. See, mis alguses Hiinas epideemiana puhkes, oli mõne kuu jooksul jõudnud peaaegu kõikidesse maailma riikidesse. Viimase 20 aasta jooksul on paljud riigid kannatanud Covid-19-ga seotud viiruste, näiteks SARS-i tõttu. Varasemate kogemuste tõttu võtsid nad viivitamatult asjakohased meetmed. Näiteks Hiinas pole pandemia algusest saadik olnud rohkem kui 110 000 juhtumit, kuigi selle rahvaarv on peaaegu 1,5 miljardit (Worldometer, 2022). Poliitiliselt vähem stabiilne riik, nagu Türgi, oli aga vähem ettevalmistatud ja kannatas 12 miljoni juhtumi all, kuigi selle elanikkond on 85 miljonit. Viirus levib väga kiiresti, sest see levib õhus. Kui inimene on nakatunud inimese läheduses, võib kandaja väljahingamine viirust kanda ja terved inimesed võivad seda sisse hingata. Maski kandmine ja distantsi hoidmine aitab vältida nakatunud isikute poolt viiruse osakeste levikut tervete inimeste lähedusse. Riikides, kus meetmeid ei rakendatud, suurenesid aga liialdased surmad. Uus omikroni variant levib 30 mutatsiooni tõttu vähemalt 20 korda kiiremini kui esialgne tüvi (Grossman ja Stahel, 2022). Õnneks on see ka palju vähem surmav, sest see ei ründa kopsukudet oma varasemates staadiumides (Zimmer ja Ghorayshi, 2021). Koronaviiruse piiranguid saab analüüsida ka eetilisest vaatevinklist: kas me peaksime vähendama koronaviiruse meetmeid, kuigi see võib ohustada rohkem elusid? Alates 28. jaanuarist 2021 on koronaviiruse suremus 0,51%. See on suhteliselt kõrge võrreldes teiste hingamisteede viirustega, nagu gripp, mille suremus on 0, 01%. COVID-19 mõjutab ebaproportsionaalselt haavatavaid rühmi, näiteks neid, kellel on sellised terviseprobleemid nagu diabeet, rasvumine või autoimmuunhaigused. See kehtib eriti eakatel, kuna neil esineb rohkem terviseprobleeme ja immuunsüsteem halveneb vanusega. Koronaviirus nakatab ülemisi hingamisteid, sealhulgas kopse. See tungib rakkudesse ja annab neile käsu luua viiruse koopiad. Seejärel puhkeb rakuke lahti ja saadab viiruse uusi koopiaid teistele rakkudele. Lõpuks, kui immuunvastus ei ole tõhus, sureb patsient kopsude kahjustuse tõttu, eriti COVID-19 tüvedega enne Omicroni varianti. Lukustumise ajal on inimestega minimaalne kokkupuude, mis aeglustab viiruse levikut. Sotsiaalsete kontaktide vältimisel on aga oma laastavad tagajärjed. Näiteks lukustumise ajal oli üle 2,5 miljoni lapse riskiga, et nad jäävad õppimisel maha (<unk>Jongeren<unk> 2021') (\"Haridus ja COVID-19\", 2022). Lisaks sellele oli OSF Healthcare andmetel \"Esimese enesetappude kahtlustamise korral noorte tüdrukute keskmine nädalane külastus kiirabiosakonda aasta tagasi sama perioodiga võrreldes üle 50% suurem\" (OSF Health Care, 2021). Seega, isegi kui rohkem elusid on ohus, võib riskirühma liikmete jaoks täiendavate meetmete võtmisega ühiskonna turvaliselt uuesti avada ja vältida noorte enesetappe ja õppimisraskusi. Peale selle võivad vaktsiinid takistada kudede suuremat kahjustamist. Ühiskondlikust vaatepunktist on koronaviirus osutunud \"lahknevaks probleemiks\", mis sunnib mõningaid inimesi vaktsineerimata jätma. Paljud kodanikud väldivad vaktsineerimist, mõistmata tõeliselt tagajärgi. Vaktsiine on kahte tüüpi: mRNA ja viirusvektor. mRNA COVID-19 vaktsiin oli esimene mRNA vaktsiin, mida kasutati üldsusel. mRNA vaktsiinides on RNA lipiidide sees, mis aitavad RNA-l rakku siseneda. Ribosoomid loevad RNA-d ja annavad rakkudele juhiseid, et nad valmistaksid samu spike-valke kui SARS-CoV-2. Seejärel tunneb keha ära, et korona spike'i valkud on sissetungijad, ja loob neid hävitamiseks antikehi. Võrdluseks võib öelda, et viirusvektorit sisaldavad vaktsiinid sisestavad viiruse ohutu koopia, millel on sama proteiini DNA, mis paneb immuunsüsteemi seda ründama ja mäletama. Mõlema vaktsiini tüübi puhul toodavad mälu B- rakud jätkuvalt antikehi, kui inimene satub tulevikus tõelise viirusega kokku. Dr. Staheli sõnul on <unk>Omicron nii palju muteerunud, et tal on vaktsiini antikehade suhtes vähem affiniteeti, et seda ära tunda, seega on vastus booster-süsti, sest sa ületad viiruse immuunvastuse kogusega, isegi kui ei ole täiuslikku vastust<unk> (Grossman ja Stahel, 2022). Seega mängivad algsed vaktsiiniannused ja hiljuti ka täiendusannused olulist rolli nakkuste ennetamisel, kuid mis veelgi olulisem - raskete haiguste ja surma tõenäosuse vähendamisel. Kuid uued uuringud on näidanud, et tõhus immuunsus võib kuue kuu jooksul kaduda, mistõttu on vaja iga-aastaseid annuseid, mis on sarnased gripile (Doucleff). 13,6% üle 18-aastastest elanikkonnast keeldub vaktsineerimisest peamiselt valitsuse suhtes tekkiva usaldamatuse tõttu (Vaksineerimine COVID-19 vaktsineerimine, 2022). See piirab karjaimmuniteedi mõju, mis tähendab, et kui vaktsineerida piisavalt inimesi, ei saa viirus enam levida, sest kõik sihtmärgid on immuunsed. Lõpuks tuleb kaaluda lukustumise majanduslikke tagajärgi. Lukustumine põhjustas tohutu tööpuuduse, eriti reisitööstuses töötavate jaoks. Näiteks Maailma Majandusfoorumi andmetel kaotasid 2020. aastal 114 miljonit inimest töökohti (Richter, 2021). Peale selle tekitasid kogu maailma lukustused hinnanguliselt 3,2 triljonit eurot tööjõutulu kahjumit. Isegi kui majandus on laastav, tuleb arvestada asjaoluga, et inimelu on ohus, kui ei võeta asjakohaseid koronavirusimeetmeid. NPRi andmetel oleks Hiinas esinenud ligikaudu 488 korda rohkem haigusi, kui oleks võetud ebapiisavaid meetmeid, päästes seega miljoneid elusid (Beaubien, 2020). Kokkuvõtteks, vaadeldes COVID-19 poliitilisest, eetilisest, sotsiaalsest ja majanduslikust vaatepunktist, jõuan ma järeldusele, et kuigi viirus on teatud rühmade suhtes väga nakkav ja surmav, on lukustamised vaid ajutised lahendused. Lukustus on meie ühiskonnale kasuliku ainult siis, kui ülemäärane suremus hakkab tõusma. Seega saavad riigid viiruse levikut piirata, kui võtavad varajased meetmed. Näiteks kulus kuus kuud, enne kui maskide kandmist peeti sobivaks abinõuks. Nagu nägime esimeses lukustamisperioodil, kaotasid kümned tuhanded inimesed oma töö ja üle 2,5 miljoni lapse pidi Hollandi kaugõppele (\"Jongeren\", 2021). Seega, kui võtta meetmeid õigel ajal ja olla ette valmistunud, ei pea inimene lukustuma. Kui aga surmad hakkavad ülemääraseks muutuma, tasub proportsionaalselt suurte korona-meetmete rakendamine.", "output": ""}

Ta polnud kunagi näinud nii säravat aaret, see oli vikerkaarest värvi, ja kui ta vaatas lähemalt, nägi see hirmsalt sarnane lohesega, kuid ta ei suutnud uskuda, et see oli tõeline lohesega, sest need eksisteerisid ainult lugudes, mida ta luges. Ta vaatas ringi ja märkas veel ühte säravat laigut, mis oli nagu leiva murdide rada, mis viis ta oma maja taga asuvasse metsa. Ta teadis, et vanemad tahavad, et ta kooli läheks, kuid uudishimu võitis ta ja ta hakkas järgnema säratute soomade jäljele metsa. Ta võitles oma teed läbi metsa, kuni ta jõudis, mis nägi välja nagu koobas, et ta oli kindel, ei olnud seal enne. Ta astus ettevaatlikult koopasse ja selle asemel, et koobas pimedaks saada, sai see heledamaks, nagu oleks koobas särav valgus. Kui ta koobas nurga pööras, nägi ta ilusaimast säravast lohe ja ei suutnud oma silmi uskuda! Ta libises aeglaselt draakoni poole, kes jälgis teda hoolikalt, kui ta lähenes. Ta sirutas käe välja, nagu et lohest hellitada ja lohe nuusutas tema kätt, seejärel hõõrutas ta pea tema käe alt, et signaali anda, et ta tahab temaga sõbrustada. Ta naeris, kui draakon puristas ja hõõrus tema säravat keha, mis teda ümbritses. Siis rääkis lohe ja küsis temalt, kas ta on kunagi olnud teisel maailmas. Tüdruk raputas pead, lohe vilgutas silmi ja projitseeris pildi koopa seinale, et näidata ühte kaunist maailma, mis oli täis lohte. Tüdruk küsis, kas lohe viib ta sinna, lohe naeris ja niitis, andes tüdrukule märku, et ta hüppaks selga. Tüdrukut vallutas erutus ja ta hüppas tagasi draakonite selga. Ta hoidis kinni, kui lohe hakkas koobast välja jooksma. Kui lohe koobast väljus, avanes portaal ja see hüppas portaali. Tüdruk sulges silmad, teadmata, mis edasi juhtub, ta lõpuks avas oma silmad ja jõllitas imestusega, kui nad tulid teispoolse maailma, ta ei suutnud uskuda, mida ta nägi, draakonid! Draakonid on igal pool! Nad ratsutasid vikerkaarel, mängisid waterfalls, ja universum oli täis ilusaid lilli, mis tõusid kõrgele nagu redwood puud.

{"model_name": "wenge-research/yayi-7b", "input": "Miks peaksid inimesed muutma oma muru- ja kaunistussõidud kohalikele taimedele?", "target": "Kellele ei meeldi liblikad? Nad on ilus süütuse sümbol. Aga kas olete märganud, et neid on igal aastal üha vähem? Kui ma olin laps, ei saanud sa reisida ilma, et auto tuuleklaasile liblikad ei jääks. Miks neid siis nii vähe on ja mida see tähendab?  Üks peamine põhjus on pestitsiidide ja herbitsiidide kasutamine. Need kemikaalid on valestikulised tapjad. Ja nad löövad kogu ökosüsteemi tasakaalust välja. Oma aias olen ma näinud, kuidas pisut kannatlikkust paneb asjad tasakaalu. Mul olid lehmad, aga aeglaselt märkasin, et lehmalehma kiskjad lahendavad probleemi. Mul olid kärbsed, sest mul oli kanakas, kuid mõne nädala jooksul nägin ma, kuidas Swallows ja Phoebes liiguvad sisse, et kasutada ära toiduallikat.  Teine põhjus, miks me näeme vähem liblikaid, on toitu rusikate jaoks. Enamik liblikaid ja liblikaid (või öiste liblikaid, nagu mulle meeldib neid kutsuda) vajavad oma tooraineid toidavat konkreetset taime. Monarh-liblikate puhul on see piimapuu (Asclepias), mis on ilusa taime jaoks ebaõnnestunud nimi. Pipevine Swallowtails puhul on see Pipevine (Aristolochia). Ilma nende taimedeta ei saa toorained. Ja kui linnad ja äärelinnad kivitatakse, ei ole nendele kunagi rikkalikele taimedele enam kohta, kus kasvada. Kui me vaatame oma õue, leiame, et seal on ilusad taimed, mis on imporditud teistest kohtadest. Kuid liblikad näevad meie õue kui kõrbe. Isegi taimed nagu pudelipuud, mis meelitavad palju putukaid nektari järele, ei anna kohalikele putukatele toitu. See on nagu oleks täiskasvanutele baar, kus juua, aga pole toitu, et toita lapsi, et nad saaksid ka täiskasvanuks kasvada.  Ent Doug Tallamy, Delaware'i ülikooli entomoloog, ütleb, et me saame aidata. Kui me paneme oma õue mõned kohalikud taimed, saame pakkuda toitu, et tuua liblikad tagasi.  Kui me valmistusime oma aeda ümber ehitama igavesest ornamentaalsest ingliskeelsest majakast/lõikusest aiast, juhtus midagi. Me nägime Dougi Tallamy't rääkimas CNPS Silicon Valley Zoom koosolekul. Ja me mõistsime, et me peame oma suunda muutma ja algama põliselanikega aiandus.  Kui me vaatame oma aeda, on oluline, et me alles alustame... See on suur eksperiment, et näha, mis kus toimib. Ja juba räägib aed meiega. Sinisilmsed rohud on ületanud kivitud kõnniteed teise osale aeda! Me ootame tulevikus rohkem liikumist ja maagiat. Siin on mõned meie mõtted meie aiast.  Õnnistused... hiiglaslik tamm meie aias ja pursk meie taga on kindlasti andnud meile jalg ette toidu ja loodus ligipääsu meie aias.  Halb külg... palju varju. Ainult kaks, võib-olla kolm kohta meie aias, mis saavad hea päikese käes. Nii et me otsime läbi Calscape'i taime, mis talub varju. (Kui te pole veel Calscape'i kohanud, on teil siin midagi imelikku. Loodan, et elad Californias...).  Talamiitidena usume ökosüsteemi toitmises, mis algab toore kasvatamisega. Kuidas see välja töötas? Me oleme seni ainult ühte või kahte kärbse näinud. Hinguta. See kõik on eksperiment...  Suurim mõju... jätab lehed möödunud aastal. Me näeme juba mulla paranemist ja iga kord, kui me kastame, näeme palju putukaid, mis tõusevad välja. Nii see juhtubki. Aeglaselt...  Me jätkame asendajate asendamist. Eelmisel nädalavahetusel võtsime Sarcococca ja Pierris Japonicas välja ja asutasime need Coffeeberry (Frangula Californica) -ga. Sellel nädalavahetusel võtsime maha kaks vaahterpuud ja asendasime need Bush Anemone'iga (Carpenteria Californica). Ja järgmisel nädalavahetusel asendame meie kasti heinaku Coyote Brush (Baccharis pilularis).  Peale putukate oleme meie aias näinud palju teisi suurepäraseid elusloomi. Igal aastal sünnib puul uus oravalapse pesa. Ja sel aastal üllatas meid see, et puule (see on suuresti õõnes) liiguvad kolm pesukarjakat.  Nad on armsad, häbelikud ja armsad.

Nende materjalide ühendamisega seadmesse, mida nimetatakse transistoriks, on meil võimalik luua elektrooniline komponent, mis juhib elektrit ainult siis, kui väikest elektrivoolu rakendatakse transistori niinimetatud baaspinni.  Sellise käitumise üks ilmselge kasutamine on kasutada transistorit lülitiks - rakendades või eemaldades voolu baaspinnale, saame kontrollida, kas transistor juhib elektrit oma kollektorite ja emitterite pintide kaudu. Kui põhipinil ei ole voolu, blokeerib transistor elektrite edastamise oma emitter- ja kollektorpintide kaudu.  Üldjuhul on transistori juhtimiseks vajalik elektrivool baaspinni juures väga väike. Seadme kaudu saab kollektorite ja emitterite pintide kaudu edastada palju suuremaid vooluvoolu. Seega kasutab transistor väga väikest sisendvoolu, et juhtida palju suurema voolu voolu.  Audio signaal, näiteks, edastatakse väga väikese võimsusega elektrilise voolu kujul - selle algsel kujul on see liiga väike, et võimaldada kõlarit juhtida, et tekitada heli, mis on kuuldav inimkõrvale. Selle signaali võimendamiseks nii, et seda saaks kasutada heli taasesitamiseks, saame kasutada transistori baaspinni, mis võimaldab palju suuremat voolu voolata emitteri ja kollektoripinide vahel ja läbi transistori. Kuna selle suure voolu vool peegeldab palju väiksemat audio signaali voolu, siis oleme tõhusalt loonud palju tugeva versiooni algsest sisendsignaalist.", "output": " The output of a transistor is a current that is dependent on the applied voltage.

Statistiliselt on eelistuste muster kergesti nähtav selles, mida inimesed nimetavad ilusaks. Selle ilmselge näide on naiste ja meeste ilu standard. Tundub, et ühiskond on ühel meelel selle üle, millised omadused, nii füüsilised kui ka sisemised, võivad inimese ilusaks pidada. Ilususe standard on suunatud ka kaugemale inimestest, näiteks kasside näituste loomaliikidele. Ilmselt on olemas seos ilu ja selle vahel, kui palju see sarnaneb täiuslikkusele. Näiteks peetakse paljude lehtedega roosi, millel ei ole pisaraid ega kriimustusi, üldiselt ilusamaks kui seda, millel on vähem, nähtavalt rikutud lehtedega roosi. Siiski tekitab täiuslikkuse küsimus ka probleemi, kuna on raske ja võib-olla võimatu defineerida täiuslikkust. Ilusus ei tähenda tingimata täiuslikkust. Näiteks peetakse suured silmad statistiliselt atraktiivsemaks, kuid nende bioloogilise otstarbe poolest ei ole neil väikeste silmade üle. Niisiis sõltub nii ilu kui ka täiuslikkus sellest, millise vaatevinkliga või milleks eesmärgiga sa vaatad midagi.  Peale selle tuleks arvestada ka ilmsete muutustega, mis on olnud läbi sajandite ja kultuuride selle osas, mida peetakse ilusaks. Näiteks mudelid ja kunsti stiilid muutuvad pidevalt.

Siin on mõned tegurid, mis mõjutavad teie investeeringute jaotamist.  - Ajaperiood: see on ajavahemik, mille jooksul kavatsete oma raha investeerida. See on oluline, sest erinevate varaklasside suhtes mõjutavad enam-vähem lühiajalised turutingimused. Sõltuvalt sellest, kui kaua soovid turul tegutseda, on sinu investeerimisstrateegias väga oluline valida varatüüp, mis vastab sinu ajahorisondile.  - Riskiprofiil: näitab, kui hästi tunned oma investeeringuid mõjutavaid turutingimusi. Suurema riskiga varad pakuvad suuremat tulu, kuid neil on ka suurem võimalus langeda või kaotada oma investeering täielikult. Riskiprofiili mõistmine on esimene samm oma raha hea investeerimise suunas. Investeeringute varad on erinevad ja vastavad erinevatele riskiastmetele. Nende kombinatsioon pakub tasakaalustatud viisi oma raha investeerimiseks.  - Aktiivne/passiivne investor: sõltuvalt sellest, kui palju soovite osaleda varade valikus ja jaotamises, loetakse teid aktiivseks või passiivseks investoriks. Aktiivsed investorid on investorid, kes kulutavad palju aega turu analüüsimisele ja oma portfelli varade valimisele. Need investorid võivad investeerida otse aktsiatesse või aktsiaoptsioonides. Passiivsed investorid on investorid, kes soovivad olla avatud turule, kuid ei soovi kulutada palju aega oma varade valimisele. Sellised investorid kasutavad börsivahendeid või investeerimisfonde, mis ühendavad eri varaklassid ühte vara, et olla avatud oma soovitud turule, ilma et neil oleks vaja valida oma alusvarasid.

Hari Seldon, matemaatik ja psühholoog, on välja töötanud psühhoajaloo, uue teaduse ja psühholoogia valdkonna, mis käsitleb kõiki võimalusi suurte ühiskondade matemaatika abil, võimaldades tulevikus toimuvate sündmuste tõenäolist ennustamist.

Ta teavitab komisjoni, et alternatiiv sellele tulevikule on saavutatav ja selgitab neile, et kogu inimteadmiste kompendiumi, Encyclopedia Galactica, loomine ei pruugi vältida impeeriumi vältimatut langust, vaid vähendaks pimeda ajastu ühe aastatuhande võrra.

{"model_name": "wenge-research/yayi-7b", "input": "Mis oli Bismarcki sõjalaev?\nContext:Bismarck oli esimene kahest Bismarck-klassi lahingulaevadest, mis ehitati Natsi-Saksamaa Kriegsmarine'i jaoks. Laev, mis sai nime kantsler Otto von Bismarcki järgi, aseti Blohm & Vossi laevatehases Hamburgis 1936. aasta juulis ja käivitati vees 1939. aasta veebruaris. Tööd lõpetati 1940. aasta augustis, kui laevast sai Saksa laevastik. Bismarck ja tema õelaev Tirpitz olid suurimad lahingulaevad, mida Saksamaa kunagi on ehitanud, ja kaks suurimatest, mida on ehitanud ükski Euroopa riik.  Sõjalaeva kaheksa-kuulise karjääri jooksul viis Bismarck läbi ainult ühe rünnakuoperatsiooni, mis kestis 8 päeva 1941. aasta mais, koodnimeks Rheinübung. Laev pidi koos raskekreiser Prinz Eugeniga murdma Atlandi ookeani ja ründama liitlaste laevu Põhja-Ameerikast Suurbritanniasse. Kaks laeva avastati mitmel korral Skandinaavias ja Briti mereväeüksused saadeti nende teed blokeerima. Taani väinas toimunud lahingus sattus rändlaev HMS Hood algselt Prinz Eugeni vastu, tõenäoliselt ekslikult, samas kui HMS Prince of Wales sattus Bismarcki vastu. Järgnenud lahingus hävitati Hood Bismarcki ja Prinz Eugeni tulekahju poolt, mis kahjustas Prince of Walesi ja sundis ta taganema. Bismarck sai Walesi prinsi poolt kolmest löögist piisavalt kahju, et sundida ründamismissiooni lõpetama.  Hood'i hävitamine ajendas Kuningliku Mereväe järeleandmatut jälitamist, milles osalesid kümned sõjalaevad. Kaks päeva hiljem, kui Bismarck suundus okupeeritud Prantsusmaale remonditööd tegema, ründasid lennukikandjal HMS Ark Royal 15 Fairey Swordfish torpedo pommitajat. Üks neist sai löögi, mis muutis sõjalaeva juhtimisseadme töövõimetuks. Järgmisel hommikul toimus viimane lahing, kus kaks Briti lahingulaeva ja kaks rasket kruiiserit võitlesid juba halvatud Bismarcki vastu. Laev sukeldati, et vältida Briti sõdurite sissetungi ja lasta laeva maha jätta, et piirata edasisi ohvreid. Enamik eksperte on ühel meelel, et lahingukahjustused oleksid põhjustanud selle uppumise.

{"model_name": "wenge-research/yayi-7b", "input": "Kirjeldage järgmise lõigu põhjal esimest tahkekujundusega seadet ja selle kasutamist.\nContext:Kaua enne, kui elektri kohta oli mingeid teadmisi, olid inimesed teadlikud elektriliste kalade poolt tekkivatest šokkidest. 2750 eKr. pärinevad iidsed Egiptuse tekstid viitasid neile kaladele kui \"Niiluse äikesele\" ja kirjeldasid neid kui kõigi teiste kalade \"kaitsjaid\". Elektriga kalade kohta teatasid tuhandeid aastaid hiljem taas iidsed kreeka, Rooma ja araabia loodusteadlased ja arstid. Mitmed iidsed kirjanikud, nagu Plinius vanem ja Scribonius Largus, tõestasid elektrilõike mõju, mida annavad elektrilõngad ja elektrirähed, ja teadsid, et sellised löögid võivad liikuda mööda juhtivaid objekte. Patsientidel, kellel olid sellised haigused nagu podagra või peavalu, kästi puudutada elektrilist kala, lootuses, et see võimukas raputus võib nad tervendada. Vahemere piirkonna iidsed kultuurid teadsid, et teatud objekte, nagu näiteks amberit, saab hõõruda kassi karvaga, et meelitada ligi kergeid objekte nagu sulged. Thales Miletusest tegi seeria vaatlusi staatilise elektri kohta umbes 600 eKr, millest ta uskus, et hõõrdumine tegi amberist magnetilise, erinevalt mineraalidest nagu magnetit, mis ei vajanud hõõrdumist. Thales eksis, kui ta uskus, et atraktsioon on tingitud magnetilisest mõjust, kuid hiljem tõestas teadus magnetismi ja elektri vahelise seose. Vaidlusaluse teooria kohaselt võisid partidel olla teadmised galvaaniseerimisest, mis põhineb Bagdadi aku avastamisel 1936. aastal, mis sarnaneb galvaanilisele rakku, kuigi pole kindel, kas artefakt oli elektriline. Elektrienergia jäi aastatuhandete vältel vaid intellektuaalseks uudishimulikuks, kuni aastal 1600, mil inglise teadlane William Gilbert kirjutas raamatu \"De Magnete\", milles ta uuris elektrit ja magnetismi hoolikalt, eristades kivimõju amberit hõõrdes tekkivast staatilisest elektrienergiast. Ta lõi uue ladinakeelse sõna electricus (\"kambri\" või \"kambri sarnane\", elektron, kreekakeelne sõna \"kambri\") viitamiseks väikeste objektide meelitamise omadusele pärast hõõrumist. See seos andis alguse inglise sõnadele \"electric\" ja \"electricity\", mis esmakordselt ilmusid trükis Thomas Browne'i 1646. aasta Pseudodoxia Epidemica's. Edasisi töid viisid läbi 17. ja 18. sajandi alguses Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray ja C. F. du Fay. Hiljem 18. sajandil tegi Benjamin Franklin ulatuslikke elektrialaseid uuringuid, müües oma vara, et oma tööd rahastada. Juunis 1752 kinnitas ta metalli võtme niisutatud ämbrijuhe põhja ja lendas ämbriga tormiohustatud taevas. Järjestikused sädelid, mis hüppasid võtmest tema käe tagant, näitasid, et välk oli tõepoolest elektriline. Ta selgitas ka Leydeni purgi näiliselt paradoksaalset käitumist kui seadet, mis säilitab suured kogused elektrilaengut nii positiivsetest kui ka negatiivsetest laengutest koosneva elektri osas. Aastal 1775 teatas Hugh Williamson Kuninglikule Ühingule sarjast katsetest, mille käigus uuriti elektrilise angeli poolt tekitatavaid šoke; samal aastal kirjeldas kirurg ja anatoom John Hunter kala elektriliste elundite struktuuri. Aastal 1791 avaldas Luigi Galvani oma bioelektromagnetika avastuse, demonstreerides, et elekter on vahend, mille abil neuronid edastavad signaale lihastele. Alessandro Volta 1800ndal aastal tsingi- ja vaskkihtde vahelduvatest kihtidest valmistatud aku ehk voolta-kuul andis teadlastele usaldusväärsema elektrienergiaallika kui varem kasutatud elektrostaatilised masinad. Elektromagnetismi, elektriliste ja magnetiliste nähtuste ühtsuse avastamine on tingitud Hans Christian Ørstedi ja André-Marie Ampère'ist aastal 1819-1820. Michael Faraday leiutas 1821. aastal elektrimootori ja Georg Ohm analüüsis matemaatiliselt elektriringi 1827. aastal. Elektrit ja magnetismi (ja valgust) ühendas lõplikult James Clerk Maxwell, eriti oma \"On Physical Lines of Force\" 1861 ja 1862.  Kuigi 19. sajandi alguses oli elektriteaduses tehtud kiireid edusamme, oli 19. sajandi lõpus elektriteaduses tehtud suurimaid edusamme. Alexander Graham Bell, Ottó Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1. baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla ja George Westinghouse muutsid elektri teaduslikust uudishimulikkusest kaasaegse elu oluliseks tööriistaks. Aastal 1887 avastas Heinrich Hertz, et ultraviolettvalgusega valgustatud elektroodid tekitavad kergemini elektrilisi sädeid. Aastal 1905 avaldas Albert Einstein artikli, milles selgitas fotoelektrilise efekti eksperimentaalseid andmeid, mis on valguse energia tulemuseks, mis on kantud diskreetsetes kvantiliseeritud pakettides, energiaga elektronid. See avastus viis kvantrevolutsiooni. Einstein sai 1921. aastal Nobeli füüsikapreemia \"fotoelektrilise efekti seaduse avastamise eest\". Fotoelektrilist efekti kasutatakse ka fotoelementides, näiteks päikesepaneelides. Esimene tahke seisundiga seade oli \"kassi vuntse detektor\", mida kasutati esmakordselt 1900. aastatel raadiosaatjates. Raadiosignaali detekteerimiseks asetatakse vuntse-sarnane juhtme kergelt kokku tahke kristalli (näiteks germaaniumikristalli)ga, et tuvastada raadiosignaal kontaktühenduse efekti abil. Tahkete komponentide puhul on vool piiratud tahkete elementide ja ühenditega, mis on spetsiaalselt loodud selle vahetamiseks ja võimendamiseks.

Traditsiooniliselt on triatlon individuaalne spordiala ja iga sportlane võistleb parima aja nimel. Sellisel juhul ei tohi sportlased saada abi kelleltki teiselt väljaspool võistlust, välja arvatud võistluse poolt heaks kiidetud vabatahtlikud, kes jagavad võistluse käigus toitu ja vett.   Hamburgi triatloni üleminekuplats (jalgrattad), 2002 Triatlonit ajastatakse viies järjestikuses etapis:  Ujumise algusest kuni esimese ülemineku alguseni (ujumisaeg); esimese ülemineku algusest kuni esimese ülemineku lõpuni (T1 aeg); jalgrattasõidu algusest jalgrattasõidu etapi lõpuni (jalgrattasõidu aeg); teise ülemineku algusest teise ülemineku lõpuni (T2 aeg); lõpuks jooksuse algusest kuni jooksuse lõpuni, millal triatlon on lõpule viidud. Tulemused avaldatakse tavaliselt ametlikel veebisaitidel ja näitavad iga triatlonisti ujumisaega, tsükli aega (sealhulgas üleminekud), jooksuaega ja koguaega. Mõned rassid kirjutavad ka üleminekuaegu eraldi.  Muud triatloni reeglid varieeruvad võistlusest võistluseni ja hõlmavad üldiselt lubatud varustuse kirjeldusi (näiteks on USAT-võistlustel lubatud ujumisfaasis mõned võistlused, kui vee temperatuur on alla 25,6 ° C (78,1 ° F)) ja keelatud sekkumine sportlaste vahel. Lisaks on triatlonis ebaseaduslik kasutada tiivusid või muid ujumisjõudude ja ujuvuse abivahendeid ning see võib kaasa tuua diskvalifitseerimise.  Üks jalgrattajalga seotud reegel on see, et võistleja kiivrit tuleb kanda enne, kui võistleja jalgratta peale ronib (või isegi teatavates jurisdiktsioonides seda omandab), ja see peab jääma, kuni võistleja jalgratast maha on astunud; võistlejat ei pea kiivrit kandma, kui ta ei ole jalgrattal (nt mehaanilise probleemi parandamise ajal). Selle reegli täitmata jätmine toob kaasa diskvalifitseerimise. Peale selle peavad kõik jalgrattad jalgrattasõidu ajal liikuma üksnes inimese jõu ja tööjõuga. Välja arvatud jalgratta surumine, on keelatud kõik kätega toimetulek. Kui võistleja jalgratta rikub, võib ta võistlust jätkata, kui ta seda teeb oma jalgrattaga. Samuti kehtivad ranged eeskirjad, mis puudutavad jalgratta kinnitamise liini. Võistlejad ei tohi hakata oma jalgrattaga sõitma enne, kui nad on selgelt märgitud joonest üle läinud. Enne seda jalgrattaga sõitmist võib trahvida (näiteks Londoni 2012. aasta olümpiamängudel määrati Suurbritannia võistleja Jonathan Brownlee'le 15-sekundiline aja trahv, kuna ta sõitis jalgrattaga liiga vara).  Võistluse ajal võib saada ka teisi aja karistusi, näiteks rattasõidu ajal rattasõidu ajal rattasõidu ajal rattasõidu ajal rattasõidu ajal rattasõidu ajal rattasõidu ajal rattasõidu ajal rattasõidu ajal rattasõidu ajal rattasõidu ajal rattasõidu ajal rattasõidu ajal rattasõidu ajal rattasõidu ajal rattasõidu ajal rattasõidu ajal rattasõidu ajal rattasõidu ajal rattasõidu ajal rattasõidu ajal rattasõidu ajal.", "target": "Triatlonit ajastatakse viies järjestikuses osas.

{"model_name": "wenge-research/yayi-7b", "input": "Võtke välja Ruben Dario luuletusele mõju avaldanud inimeste nimed\nContext:Prantsuse luuletus oli Darío luuletuse kujunemisel otsustav mõju. Esiteks, romantikud, eriti Victor Hugo. Hiljem mõjutasid Darío't otsustavalt parnassilased: Théophile Gautier, Catulle Mendès ja José María de Heredia. Veel üks otsustav mõju avaldas Kuuba proosa- ja luuletaja ning rahvuskangelane Jose Martí. Dariani esteetika viimane määratlev element on tema imetlus sümboolistide, eriti Paul Verlaine'i vastu. Oma poeetilise trajektoori kokkuvõttes Cantos de vida y esperanza (1905) alglauluses koondas Darío ise oma peamisi mõjusid, kui ta kinnitab, et ta oli \"Hugoga tugev ja Verlaine'iga ebaselge\" (\"con Hugo fuerte y con Verlaine ambiguo\").  Prosas Profanas'e (1896) jaotises \"Palabras Liminares\" oli ta juba kirjutanud paragrahvi, mis näitab Prantsuse kultuuri tähtsust tema kirjandusliku töö arengus:  Valge habemega vana hispaanlane osutab silmapaistvate portreede sarjale: \"See on - ütleb ta - suur Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, ühekäeline geenius; see on Lope de Vega, see on Garcilaso, see on Quintana\". Ma palun teda õilisest mehest Graciánist, Teresa Avillast, vaprast Góngorast ja kõige tugevamast kõigist, Francisco de Quevedo y Villegast. Siis ma ütlen: \"Shakespeare! Dante! - Mida? Hugo...! (ja mu peas: Verlaine...!) \" Siis, kui hüvasti jätad: \"Vanamees, on oluline öelda: mu naine on minu maalt; mu armuke on Pariisist\".  Los raros on illustreeriv raamat kirjanduslikele maitsele, mis ilmus samal aastal kui Prosas profanas ja mis on pühendatud mõnele kirjanikule ja intellektuaalile, kellele ta tundis sügavat imetlust. Nende seas on Edgar Allan Poe, Villiers de l'Isle Adam, Léon Bloy, Paul Verlaine, Lautréamont, Eugénio de Castro ja José Martí (viimane on ainus, keda mainiti, kes kirjutas oma kirjanduslikku tööd hispaania keeles). Prantsuse kultuuri domineerimine on enam kui ilmne. Darío kirjutas: \"Modernism ei ole midagi muud kui hispaania luuletus ja proos, mis on läbinud hea prantsuse luuletuse ja hea prantsuse proosise peenest siibist\". Jättes kõrvale oma esialgne etapp, enne Azul..., kus tema luuletus võlgneb suuresti 19. sajandi Hispaania luuletuse suurte nimedega, nagu Núñez de Arce ja Campoamor, oli Darío Bécqueri suur austaja. Hispaania teemad on tema töös hästi esindatud juba Prosas profanas'es ja eriti pärast tema teist Hispaania reisi 1899. aastal. Teades kaasaegset Hispaania dekadentsust poliitikas ja kunstides (asjaolu, mida ta jagas nn 1998. aasta põlvkonnaga), inspireeris teda sageli mineviku tegelased ja elemendid. Teistes keeltes kirjutatud autorite kohta tasub mainida, et ta tundis sügavat imetlust kolme Ameerika Ühendriikide kirjaniku vastu: Ralph Waldo Emerson, Edgar Allan Poe ja Walt Whitman.", "target": "Victor Hugo Théophile Gautier Catulle Mendès José María de Heredia José Martí Paul Verlaine Edgar Allan Poe Villiers de l'Isle Adam Léon Bloy Lautréamont Eugénio de Castro Ralph Waldo Emerson Walt Whitman", "output": " Teistes seonud: \"Ameerika Ühendriikide!\".

Mõte, et majapuuviljad mõjutavad märkimisväärselt siseruumide õhukvaliteeti, põhineb suuresti NASA poolt 1980. aastatel läbi viidud puhta õhu uuringul. Uuringus katsetati taimed suletud kambrites, kus esinesid väga suured lenduvate orgaaniliste ühendite (eriti benseeni, triklooretüleen ja formaldehüüdi) sisaldus. Ta jõudis järeldusele, et kuivõrd toatemehhanismid parandavad õhukvaliteeti, on selle toimemehhanismeks mitte taimed ise, vaid mullas asuvad mikroorganismid.  Majapidudel on statistiliselt oluline mõju nii süsinikdioksiidi kui ka süsinikdioksiidi kontsentratsioonile tavalises sisekeskkonnas, vähendades süsinikdioksiidi taset 10-25% ja süsinikdioksiidi taset kuni 90%. Seda efekti on NASA uurinud kosmoselaevade kasutamiseks.  Samuti näib, et taimed suurendavad kodudes bakterite arvu ja mitmekesisust, vähendades samal ajal seenete mitmekesisust. Need suurendavad tavaliselt niiskust, vähendavad temperatuuri kõikumisi ja vähendavad müra.  Samuti väidetakse, et majapuude kasvatamisel on palju psühholoogilisi ja füsioloogilisi eeliseid. Eksperimentaalse kirjanduse kriitiline ülevaade järeldas, et läbivaadatud uuringud näitavad, et siseruumid võivad anda psühholoogilisi eeliseid, nagu stressi vähendamine ja suurenenud valu taluvus. Siiski näitasid nad ka märkimisväärset erinevust meetodites ja tulemustes.

{"model_name": "wenge-research/yayi-7b", "input": "NATO ajalugu kokkuvõtlikult\nContext:Dunkerque'i leping allkirjastati Prantsusmaa ja Ühendkuningriigi vahel 4. märtsil 1947, pärast Teist maailmasõda ja külma sõja algust, kui liitlus- ja vastastikuse abi leping Saksamaa või Nõukogude Liidu võimalike rünnakute korral. 1948. aasta märtsis laiendati seda liitu Brüsseli lepinguga, et hõlmata Beneluxi riike, moodustades Brüsseli lepingu organisatsiooni, mida tuntakse üldiselt kui Lääne Liitu. Samal kuul alustati ka läbirääkimisi laiema sõjalise liitluse üle, mis võiks hõlmata Põhja-Ameerikat, Ameerika Ühendriikides, kus nende välispoliitika Truman Doktriini alusel edendas rahvusvahelist solidaarsust kommunistliku agressiooniga seotud tegude vastu, nagu näiteks 1948. aasta veebruari riigipöörde Tšehhoslovakkias. Nende läbirääkimiste tulemuseks oli Põhja-Atlandi lepingu allkirjastamine 4. aprillil 1949 Lääne-Euroopa Liidu liikmesriikide ning Ameerika Ühendriikide, Kanada, Portugali, Itaalia, Norra, Taani ja Islandi poolt. Kanada diplomaat Lester B. Pearson oli lepingu peamine autor ja koostur.  Pikk ristkülikukujuline ruum, kus mõlemal küljel on mitu rida istunud isikut ja kaugel otsal riputatud lipud. Lääne-Saksamaa liitus NATOga 1955. aastal, mis viis külma sõja ajal Varssavi pakti moodustumiseni. Põhja-Atlandi leping oli suurel määral uinuv, kuni Korea sõda algatas NATO asutamise, et rakendada seda integreeritud sõjalise struktuuriga. See hõlmas 1951. aastal Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) moodustamist, mis võttis omaks palju Lääne-Liidu sõjalisi struktuure ja plaane, sealhulgas nende varustuse standardiseerimise lepinguid ja lepingud välisriikide sõjaliste jõudude paigutamise kohta Euroopa riikides. 1952. aastal loodi NATO peasekretäri ametikoht organisatsiooni peamise tsiviilisiku ametikohana. Samal aastal toimusid ka esimesed NATO merel toimuvad suured manööverid, mis olid \"Mainbrace\" ja Kreeka ja Türgi ühinemine organisatsiooniga. Pärast Londoni ja Pariisi konverentse lubati Lääne-Saksamaal sõjaväe ümberrustamist, sest nad ühinesid NATOga 1955. aasta mais, mis oli omakorda peamine tegur Nõukogude domineeritud Varssavi pakti loomisel, piirates külma sõja kaks vastandlikku poolt.  Berliini müüri ehitamine 1961. aastal tähistas külma sõja pingeid, kui Euroopas oli paigutatud 400 000 USA sõdurit. Kahtlused Euroopa riikide ja Ameerika Ühendriikide vaheliste suhete tugevuse üle kasvasid ja vähenesid, samuti kahtlused NATO kaitse usaldusväärsuse üle võimaliku Nõukogude sissetungi vastu - kahtlused, mis viisid sõltumatute Prantsuse tuumahäire arendamiseni ja Prantsusmaa väljaastumiseni NATO sõjalisest struktuurist 1966. aastal. 1982. aastal ühines liiduga uus demokraatlik Hispaania.  1989. aasta revolutsioonid Euroopas viisid NATO eesmärgi, olemuse, ülesannete ja fookuse strateegilisele ümberhindamisele mandril. 1990. aasta oktoobris sai Ida-Saksamaalt Saksamaa Liitvabariik ja liit, ning 1990. aasta novembris allkirjastas liit Pariisis Nõukogude Liiduga Euroopa Tavaliste Relvastatud Jõudude lepingu (CFE). See määras konkreetsed sõjalised vähendamised kogu mandril, mis jätkusid pärast Varssavi pakti lagunemist 1991. aasta veebruaris ja Nõukogude Liidu lagunemist samal detsembris, mis eemaldas NATO de facto peamisi vastaseid. Sellega algas Euroopas sõjaliste kulude ja varustuse vähendamine. CFE leping lubas allkirjastanud riikidel eemaldada järgneva kuusteistkümne aasta jooksul 52 000 tavalist relva ja lubas NATO Euroopa liikmete sõjalistel kulutustel väheneda 28 protsenti aastatel 1990-2015. 1990. aastal kinnitasid mitmed Lääne liidrid Mihail Gorbatšovile, et NATO ei laiene kaugemale itta, nagu selgus eravestluste memorandumitest. Selle aasta lõpus allkirjastatud Saksamaa suhtes lõplikku lahendust käsitleva lepingu lõplikus tekstis ei mainitud siiski ida suunas laienemise küsimust.  Kaks kõrget betoonist seina osatähtsust rohumaal, mis asub sinise klaasist akendega kumer hoone ees. Berliini müüri langemine 1989. aastal tähistas pöördepunkti NATO rollis Euroopas ja see müüri osa on nüüd NATO peakorteri ees. 1990. aastatel laiendas organisatsioon oma tegevust poliitilistele ja humanitaarolukordadele, mis varem ei olnud NATO mure. Jugoslaavia lagunemise ajal korraldas organisatsioon oma esimesed sõjalised sekkumised Bosnias aastatel 1992-1995 ja hiljem Jugoslaavias 1999. aastal. Need konfliktid ajendasid külma sõjajärgset suurt sõjalist ümberkorraldamist. NATO sõjaline struktuur vähendati ja reorganiseeriti, loodi uued jõud, nagu näiteks Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps'i peakorter.  Poliitiliselt püüdis organisatsioon parandada suhteid uued autonoomsed Kesk- ja Ida-Euroopa riigid ning diplomaatilised foorumid piirkondliku koostöö jaoks NATO ja selle naabrite vahel loodi sel külma sõjajärgsel perioodil, sealhulgas partnerlus rahu ja Vahemere dialoogi algatuse nimel 1994. aastal, Euro-Atlandi partnerlusnõukogu 1997. aastal ja NATO-Venemaa alaline ühisnõukogu 1998. aastal. 1999. aasta Washingtoni tippkohtumisel liitusid ametlikult NATOga Ungari, Poola ja Tšehhi Vabariik ning organisatsioon andis välja ka uued liitumise suunised koos individuaalsete \"Liitumise tegevuskavadega\". Need plaanid reguleerisid uute liitlaste lisamist. Prantsusmaa presidendi Nicolas Sarkozy valimine 2007. aastal viis Prantsusmaa sõjalise positsiooni ulatusliku reformini, mis kulmineerus 4. aprillil 2009 täieõigusliku liikmesuse taastamisega, mis hõlmas ka Prantsusmaa taasühinemist NATO sõjalise juhtimisstruktuuriga, säilitades samal ajal sõltumatu tuumarežiimi.  Põhja-Atlandi lepingu artikkel 5, mis nõuab liikmesriikidelt abi mis tahes liikmesriigile, kellele on tehtud relvastatud rünnak, kasutati esimest ja ainsat korda pärast 11. septembri rünnakuid, mille järel lähetati väed Afganistani NATO juhitud ISAFi all. Alates sellest ajast on organisatsioon täitnud mitmesuguseid täiendavaid ülesandeid, sealhulgas on saatnud väljaõpetajaid Iraaki, aidanud kaasa piraatluse vastaste operatsioonide korraldamisele ja 2011. aastal kehtestanud Liibüa üle lennukeelutsooni kooskõlas ÜRO Julgeolekunõukogu resolutsiooniga 1973.  Venemaa Krimmi annekteerimine põhjustas kõigil NATO liikmetel karmi hukkamõistmise ja oli üks seitsmest juhtumist, mil artiklit 4, mis nõuab NATO liikmete vahelist konsulteerimist, on kasutatud. Varasemad ajad, sealhulgas Iraagi sõda ja Süüria kodusõda. 2014. aasta Walesi tippkohtumisel lubasid NATO liikmesriikide juhid esimest korda ametlikult kulutada kaitseks 2024. aastaks vähemalt kaks protsenti oma sisemajanduse kogutoodangust, mis oli varem olnud ainult mitteametlik suunis. 2016. aasta Varssavi tippkohtumisel leppisid NATO riigid kokku NATO tõhustatud esipresidendi loomisel, mis paigutas Eestis, Lätis, Leedus ja Poolas neli rahvusvahelist pataljoni suurust lahingugruppi. Enne 2022. aasta Vene sissetungi Ukrainasse ja selle ajal saatsid mitmed NATO riigid maavägesid, sõjalaevu ja lahingulennukeid, et tugevdada allianssi idapoolset tiibat, ja mitmed riigid kasutasid taas artiklit 4. 2022. aasta märtsis kohtusid NATO liidrid Brüsselis erakorralise tippkohtumise raames, kuhu osalesid ka seitsme riigi liidrid ja Euroopa Liidu liidrid. NATO liikmesriigid leppisid kokku luua neli täiendavat lahingugruppi Bulgaarias, Ungaris, Rumeenias ja Slovakkias ning esimest korda NATO ajaloos aktiveeriti NATO reageerimisjõudude elemendid.  Alates 2022. aasta juunist oli NATO paigutanud 2500 kilomeetri pikkune idapoolsuse äärde 40 000 sõdurit, et takistada Venemaa agressiooni. Rohkem kui pooled neist on lähetatud Bulgaaria, Rumeenia, Ungari, Slovakkia ja Poola, kus viis riiki moodustavad 259 000 endise NATO sõjaväelase. Bulgaaria õhujõudude täiendamiseks saatis Hispaania Eurofighter Typhoon'id, Madalmaad saadeti kaheksa F-35 rünnakulennukit ning varsti saabusid ka täiendavad Prantsuse ja USA rünnakulennukid.

Selle liikmed olid 1949. aastal Ameerika Ühendriigid, Belgia, Madalmaad, Luksemburg, Prantsusmaa, Ühendkuningriik, Kanada, Portugal, Itaalia, Norra, Taani ja Island. 18. veebruaril 1952 ühinesid ka Kreeka ja Türgi.  Kui Lääne-Saksamaa liitus organisatsiooniga 9. mail 1955, kirjeldas Norra tolleaegne välisminister Halvard Lange seda kui \"otsustavat pöördepunkti meie mandri ajaloos\". Selle tulemuseks oli Varssavi pakt, mille allkirjastasid 14. mail 1955 Nõukogude Liit ja selle satelliitriigid vastuseks NATO-le.

Kivistumise protsess toimub maa all, kui puit mattub vees või vulkaanilises tuhkas. Vee olemasolu vähendab hapniku kättesaadavust, mis pärsib bakterite ja seente aerobset lagunemist. Mineraalidega koormatud vesi, mis voolab läbi setete, võib põhjustada permineraalsust, mis tekib siis, kui mineraalid jäävad lahusest välja ja täidavad rakkude sisemusi ja muid tühiseid ruume. Asendamise ajal toimivad taime rakumüürid mineraalsuse malliks. Seluloosi, ligniini ja mineraalide lagunemise vahel peab olema tasakaal, et rakkude detailid jääksid täpselt säilima.

Kvantitatiivne kergendamine on rahapoliitika uus vorm, mida hakati laialdaselt rakendama pärast 2007.-2008. aasta finantskriisi. Selle eesmärk on leevendada majanduslangust, kui inflatsioon on väga madal või negatiivne, muutes tavapärase rahapoliitika ebaefektiivseks. Kvantitatiivse karmistamise (QT) tulemus on vastupidine, kui rahapoliitilistel põhjustel müüb keskpank osa oma valitsuse võlakirjadest või muudest finantsvaradest.  Sarnaselt rahapoliitika elluviimiseks kasutatavate tavapäraste avatud turuoperatsioonidega rakendab keskpank kvantitatiivset kergendamist, ostes finantsaktivaid kommertspankadelt ja muudelt finantseerimisasutustelt, tõstes seega nende finantsaktiva hindasid ja vähendades nende tootlikkust, suurendades samal ajal rahapakkumist. Erinevalt tavapärasest poliitikast hõlmab kvantitatiivne leevendamine aga tavaliselt riskantsemate või pikemaajaliste varade (mitte lühiajaliste riigivõlakirjade) suurel hulgal eelnevalt kindlaksmääratud summade ostmist eelnevalt määratud ajavahemiku jooksul.  Keskpangad kasutavad tavaliselt kvantitatiivset kergendamist, kui nende nominaal intressimäära eesmärk on null või selle lähedal. Väga madalad intressimäärad põhjustavad likviidsus lõksu, olukorda, kus inimesed eelistavad hoida sularaha või väga likviidseid varasid, arvestades muude finantsvarade madalat tootlust. See muudab intressimäärade langemise alla nulli keeruliseks; siis võivad rahaasutused kasutada kvantitatiivset kergendamist majanduse edasiseks stimuleerimiseks pigem, kui püüda intressimäära veelgi alandada.  Kvantitatiivne kergendamine võib aidata majandust majanduslangusest välja tuua ja aidata tagada, et inflatsioon ei langeks allapoole keskpanka inflatsioonieesmärki.

Ta oli Pamela Cox Bryanti ja endise NBA mängija Joe Bryanti noorim kolmest lapsest. Ta oli ka NBA mängija John \"Chubby\" Coxi õepoeg. Tema vanemad nimetasid ta Jaapani Kobe kuulsa veiseliha järgi, mida nad nägid restorani menüüs. Tema keskmine nimi, Bean, on tuletatud tema isa hüüdnimest \"Jellybean\". Bryanti perekond oli katoliiklane ja tema kasvatati sellesse usku.  Bryant hakkas korvpalli mängima, kui ta oli kolm, ja Lakers oli tema lemmik meeskond, kui ta kasvas üles. Kui Bryant oli kuuene, läks ta isa NBA-st pensionile ja kolis perega Itaaliasse Rieti, et jätkata professionaalse korvpalli mängimist. Kahe aasta pärast kolisid nad kõigepealt Reggio Calabriasse, seejärel Pistoia ja Reggio Emilia. Kobe harjus oma uuele elustiilile ja õppis Itaalia keelt sujuvalt rääkima. Talle meeldis eriti Reggio Emilia, mida ta pidas armastavaks kohaks ja kus tekkisid mõned tema parimad lapsepõlve mälestused. Bryant hakkas mängima korvpalli tõsiselt, kui elas Reggio Emilia. Bryanti vanaisa saatis talle videoid NBA mängudest, et Bryant neid uuriks. Teine inspiratsiooniallikas olid Euroopa spordianimatsioonid, millest ta õppis rohkem korvpalli kohta. Aastatel 1987-1989 mängis tema isa Olimpia Basket Pistoia meeskonnas, kus ta mängis koos endise Detroit Pistons'i Leon Douglasega. Kobe töötas mängudel palli ja moppi poisina ning harjutas laskmist poolajal, kusjuures Douglas jagas: \"Igas meie mängus poolajal oli see Kobe show. Ta läks välja ja tegi oma lasked. Me tulime riietusruumist välja ja pidime teda väljakult minema ajama\".  Bryant õppis ka jalgpalli mängima ja tema lemmikjalgpalli meeskond oli AC Milan. Suvel tuli Bryant tagasi Ameerika Ühendriikidesse, et mängida korvpalliliigas.

Individud, organisatsioonid ja riigid on varustatud või omandavad spetsialiseeritud võimeid ja moodustavad kas kombinatsioone või kaubelda, et kasutada teiste võimeid lisaks omaendale. Spetsiaalsed võimed võivad hõlmata varustust või loodusvarasid ning oskusi. Haridus ja varustuse ja muude vahendite kombinatsioonid, mis toimivad koos, on sageli olulised. Näiteks võib üksikisik spetsialiseeruda, omandades tööriistad ja oskused neid tõhusalt kasutada, nagu organisatsioon võib spetsialiseeruda, omandades spetsialiseeritud seadmeid ja palkama või koolitades oskuslikke operaatoreid. Tööjaotus on kaubanduse motiiv ja majandusliku vastastikuse sõltuvuse allikas.  Ajalooliselt on tööjaotuse suurenemine seotud kogutoodangu ja kaubanduse kasvu, kapitalismi tõusu ja industrialiseeritud protsesside üha suureneva keerukusega. Tööjaotuse kontseptsioon ja rakendamine on täheldatud iidses Sumeri (Mesopotamia) kultuuris, kus töökohtade määramine mõnes linnas langes kokku kaubanduse ja majandusliku vastastikuse sõltuvuse suurenemisega. Tööjaotus suurendab üldiselt tootlikkust nii tootja kui ka üksiku töötaja puhul.  Pärast neoliitika revolutsiooni viisid karjakasvatus ja põllumajandus usaldusväärsemate ja rikkalikumaid toiduaineid, mis suurendas rahvaarvu ja viis töö spetsialiseerumiseni, kaasa arvatud uued käsitööliste, sõdalaste klassid ja eliidi areng.

See on suurim neljast Madalmaade Kuningriigi osariigist. Madalmaad koosnevad kaheteistkümnest provintsist; see piirneb Saksamaaga idas ja Belgiaga lõunas, Põhja mere rannikualaga põhja ja lääne poole. Sellel on Põhja-Merel ühised merepiirid Ühendkuningriigi, Saksamaa ja Belgiaga. Riigi ametlik keel on hollandi keel, Lääne-Friisi keel on Frisimaa provintsis teisejärguline ametlik keel. Kariibi piirkonnas on ametlikud hollandi, inglise ja papiamento keeled.   Neli Hollandi suurimat linna on Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Haag ja Utrecht. Amsterdam on riigi kõige rahvarohkem linn ja nominaalne pealinn. Haagis asuvad Riigikogu, valitsuse ja ülemkohus. Rotterdami sadam on Euroopa kõige hõivatud sadam. Schiphol on Hollandi kõige hõivatud lennujaam ja Euroopa kolmandal kohal. Madalmaad on Euroopa Liidu, euroala, G10-, NATO-, OECD- ja WTO asutajaliige, samuti osa Schengeni alast ja kolmpoolsest Beneluxi liidust. Seal on mitu valitsustevahelist organisatsiooni ja rahvusvahelist kohut, millest paljudel on Haagi peakorter.   Madalmaad tähendab sõna otseses mõttes madalamaid riike, viidates oma madalale kõrgusele ja tasasele topograafiale, kus peaaegu 26% langeb merepinnast madalamale. Enamik merepinnast madalamatest aladest, mida tuntakse polderitena, on 14. sajandil alanud maa taaskasutamise tulemus. 1588. aastal algaval vabariikliku perioodil sisenes Madalmaad poliitilise, majandusliku ja kultuurilise hiilguseni, mis oli üks võimsamaid ja mõjukamaid Euroopas ja maailmas; see periood on tuntud kui Hollandi kuldne ajastu. Selle aja jooksul asutasid tema kaubandusettevõtted, Hollandi Ida-India Kompanii ja Hollandi Lääne-India Kompanii, kolooniad ja kaubanduspostid üle kogu maailma.   Oma 17,8 miljoni elanikuga, kes kõik elavad 41 850 km2 pindalal, millest 33 500 km2 pindalal, on Madalmaad 16. kõige tihedamalt asustatud riik maailmas ja teine kõige tihedamalt asustatud riik Euroopa Liidus, kus tihedus on 531 inimest ruutkilomeetri kohta. Sellest hoolimata on see maailma suuruselt teine toiduainete ja põllumajandustoodete eksportija, tänu oma viljakasele pinnasele, leebele kliimale, intensiivsele põllumajandusele ja leiutavusele.   Madalmaad on alates 1848. aastast olnud parlamentaarne konstitutsiooniline monarhia, millel on ühtsuslik struktuur. Riigil on traditsiooniline pillariseerimine ja pikaajaline sotsiaalne sallivus, mis on legaliseerinud abordi, prostitutsiooni ja eutanaasiat ning säilitanud liberaalse narkopoliitika. Madalmaad lubasid naistele valimisõigust 1919. aastal ja olid esimesed riigid, kes legaliseerisid 2001. aastal samasooliste abielu.

Mõned kasutavad neid isegi oma väiksemate sugulaste, alpaka, kaitsmiseks. Neid kasutatakse kõige sagedamini Ameerika Ühendriikide lääneosas, kus on levinud suuremad kiskjad, nagu kojoodid ja metsikud koerad. Tavaliselt kasutatakse ühte kastreeritud isast.  Uuringud näitavad, et mitmete valvelamade kasutamine ei ole nii tõhus kui üks. Mitmed isased kipuvad pigem üksteisega kui karjaga siduma ja võivad karja ignoreerida. Kaheaastane kiilakas isane seob end oma uutele loomadele tihedalt ning on instinktiivselt väga tõhus röövli ärahoidmisel. Mõned laamad paistavad kiinduma lambade või kitsedega kiiremini, kui neid tutvustatakse vahetult enne lammaste sünnitamist. Paljud lammaste ja kitsede tootjad väidavad, et lambade ja nende valvelamade vahel tekib kiiresti eriline side ning lamad kaitsevad lambasid eriti hästi.  Laamade kasutamine valvuritena on vähendanud paljude tootjate kaotusi kiskjate ees. Igal aastal päästetud kariloomade väärtus ületab laama ostmise ja aastase hooldamise kulusid.
