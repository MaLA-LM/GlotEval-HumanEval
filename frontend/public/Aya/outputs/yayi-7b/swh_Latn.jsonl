Serikali za kikomunisti zilizotegemewa ziliwekwa katika mataifa ya satellite ya Eastern Bloc. Baada ya kuwa serikali ya pili ya nyuklia ulimwenguni, Muungano wa Sovieti ulianzisha muungano wa Mkataba wa Warsaw, na kuingia katika mapambano ya kutawala ulimwengu, yanayojulikana kama Vita Baridi, pamoja na Marekani na NATO. Baada ya kifo cha Stalin mnamo 1953 na kipindi kifupi cha utawala wa pamoja, kiongozi mpya Nikita Khrushchev alimshutumu Stalin na kuzindua sera ya de-Stalinization, akitoa wafungwa wengi wa kisiasa kutoka kambi za kazi za Gulag. Kupunguzwa kwa ujumla kwa sera za ukandamizaji kulijulikana baadaye kuwa Kupunguzwa kwa Khrushchev. Wakati huohuo, mvutano wa Vita Baridi ulifikia kilele wakati wapinzani hao wawili walipogombana kuhusu kupelekwa kwa makombora ya Jupiter ya Marekani nchini Uturuki na makombora ya Sovieti nchini Kuba.

Kufuatia kufukuzwa kwa Khrushchev katika 1964, kipindi kingine cha utawala wa pamoja kilifuata, mpaka Leonid Brezhnev akawa kiongozi. Enzi ya miaka ya 1970 na mwanzoni mwa miaka ya 1980 baadaye ilitajwa kuwa Enzi ya Ukimya. Marekebisho ya Kosygin ya mwaka wa 1965 yalikusudiwa kupunguza sehemu ya usimamizi wa uchumi wa Sovieti.

Mnamo Mei 1988, Wasovieti walianza kuondoka Afghanistan, kutokana na upinzani wa kimataifa, vita vya wapiganaji wa kikatili dhidi ya Wasovieti, na ukosefu wa msaada kutoka kwa raia wa Soviet.  Kuanzia 1985 na kuendelea, kiongozi wa mwisho wa Urusi Mikhail Gorbachev, ambaye alitafuta kutekeleza mageuzi huria katika mfumo wa Urusi, alianzisha sera za glasnost (uwazi) na perestroika (kubadilisha muundo) katika jaribio la kumaliza kipindi cha utulivu wa uchumi na kuhamasisha serikali.

Nimefikiria sana jambo hilo na kufanya utafiti mwingi kuhusu mambo ambayo huenda yakahusika. Ninafahamu kwamba kuwa na mnyama ni ahadi kubwa hivyo ninawaandikia kueleza kwa nini nadhani unapaswa kuninunulia kasa wa kipenzi na kwa nini kasa ni uchaguzi wa ajabu wa wanyama wa kipenzi.  Kutunza kasa wa kufugwa kunanipa hisia yenye nguvu ya daraka. Najua kwamba nitalazimika kuhakikisha kwamba kasa wangu ana chakula cha kutosha, ana joto linalofaa, na anapewa nafasi ya kujifurahisha chini ya taa yenye joto au katika jua ikiwa lina joto la kutosha. Niko tayari kutumia wakati na kujitoa kwa ajili ya kasa wangu. Turtle itakuwa wajibu wangu pekee na nahisi kukomaa kutosha kujitolea kwa huduma yake na furaha.  Kama ujuavyo, mimi hupatwa na wasiwasi na shule hunifanya nihangaike hasa nyakati nyingine. Imethibitishwa kupitia uchunguzi mbalimbali kwamba wanyama-vipenzi hupunguza wasiwasi na mfadhaiko kwa wanadamu. Nina hakika kwamba kuwa na kasa kutanifanya nisiwe na wasiwasi na kuniletea furaha nyingi. Kinyume na maoni ya watu wengi, kasa hupenda kupendwa na kusumbuliwa na kunyolewa na nadhani ingekuwa jambo la kupumzika sana kwangu kupapasa kasa ninaporudi nyumbani kutoka shuleni.  Kasa hujitegemea sana. Maadamu wanapewa mahali penye joto pa kujifurahisha, maji safi na chakula kingi safi kama vile dandelions, kale, saladi na mboga nyingine za majani, wanafurahi sana kuachwa kwa njia yao wenyewe. Kwa kuwa tunaishi Uingereza ambako hali ya joto inaweza kuwa baridi, tungehitaji kununua meza ya kasa yenye msingi mzuri, taa ya kuota jua na ngozi ambazo kasa anaweza kujificha. Tuna nafasi nyingi kwa ajili ya hii katika jikoni yetu. Wakati wa joto, kasa aweza kuingia katika bustani yetu akiwa ndani ya kibanda. Meza ya kasa na taa zitagharimu karibu £200 lakini hii ni tu gharama ya awali. Baada ya hapo, ni rahisi sana kuwa na kasa. Kwa kweli, unaweza kuokota chakula chao bila malipo kwa kutafuta chakula ambacho ninafurahi kukipata tunapoenda kutembea pamoja kama familia.  Kinyume na maoni ya watu wengi, kasa wanaweza kuwa wenye urafiki sana. Kama nilivyosema hapo juu, wao hupenda kupendwa lakini je, ulijua pia kwamba wanaweza kuwatambua wamiliki wao na wengine wanaweza hata kuitikia majina yao? Kwa kweli, utafiti mmoja ulionyesha kwamba kasa wanaweza kuwatambua wamiliki wao wa zamani ambao hawajawahi kuwaona kwa miaka mingi, kwa hiyo wao ni wenye urafiki na wenye akili sana. Unaweza kuwa na wasiwasi kuhusu hibernating kasa lakini nimefanya mengi ya utafiti juu ya hili na sasa kujua hasa nini cha kufanya. Tukinunua kasa, atahitaji kulala kwa muda wa miezi mitatu kuanzia mwishoni mwa Septemba. Itabidi tumhifadhi kasa wetu katika sanduku lililohifadhiwa vizuri ili apate usingizi wa muda mrefu. Joto halipaswi kwenda juu au chini ya digrii 5 Celsius na karakana yetu itakuwa mahali kamili kwa ajili yake. Tuna kipimo cha joto ndani yake ili niweze kufuatilia kiwango cha joto.  Hatimaye, nimechunguza gharama ya kununua kasa. Ningependekeza tununue kasa ambaye ana umri wa miaka michache kwa kuwa wanahitaji utunzaji mdogo. Tunaweza kununua kamba-mti wa kabla ya kupendwa ambaye amekuwa microchiped kwa kuhusu £ 100. Na tunapoenda likizo, nimepata Hoteli ya Turtle ambayo inaendeshwa na daktari wa wanyama na inagharimu pauni 60 tu kwa kukaa siku 10.  Nadhani utakubali kwamba nimefanya utafiti wa kina sana kuhusu kutunza kasa na natumaini utakubali kwamba sasa nimekomaa vya kutosha kutunza mnyama-kipenzi. Ninaamini kabisa kwamba kuwa na kasa wa kufugwa kutanifanya nijihisi kuwa na daraka kubwa na kutakuwa na matokeo mazuri ya kutuliza hisia zangu. Kwa kweli, nadhani familia nzima itafurahia kuwa na kasa. Wao ni wanyama wenye urafiki, wenye upendo, wenye kupendeza na wenye akili na sote tutafaidika kuwa na mmoja.

{"model_name": "wenge-research/yayi-7b", "input": "Andika insha kuhusu iwapo hatua za sera za corona zina manufaa kwa jamii au la", "target": "Baada ya karibu miaka miwili ya janga la COVID-19 na kizuizi kingine, watu wengi kote Uholanzi wanazidi kuwa na wasiwasi na wamechoka na vizuizi. Kulingana na Rijksoverheid, rekodi ya kuvunja rekodi ya visa 74,000 ilithibitishwa nchini Uholanzi mnamo Januari 28, na wagonjwa kumi tu wa ICU au vifo vinavyohusiana na corona (<unk>Maambukizi-Kesi Zilizothibitishwa<unk>, 2022). Hii inaibua mjadala: Je, serikali inapaswa kuendelea kutekeleza hatua hizi au la? Ili kujibu swali hilo, ni lazima kwanza tuelewe virusi hivyo na jinsi vinavyoenea, na kisha tuchunguze mjadala huo kwa mtazamo wa kisiasa, maadili, kijamii na kiuchumi. Kisa cha kwanza kilichoripotiwa cha SARS-CoV-2, ambacho husababisha ugonjwa wa COVID-19, kilitokea mnamo Desemba 31, 2019 (\"ugonjwa wa Coronavirus\", 2022), na kilizindua mfuatano wa kutokuwa na utulivu wa kisiasa ulimwenguni kote. Ugonjwa huo ulianza nchini China na baada ya miezi michache ukaenea katika karibu kila nchi ulimwenguni. Katika miaka 20 iliyopita, nchi nyingi zimeathiriwa na virusi vinavyohusiana na Covid-19 kama vile SARS. Kwa sababu ya mambo waliyojionea hapo awali, walichukua hatua zinazofaa mara moja. Kwa mfano, China imekuwa na zaidi ya visa 110,000 tangu kuanza kwa janga hilo, ingawa ina idadi ya watu karibu bilioni 1.5 (Worldometer, 2022). Hata hivyo, nchi isiyo na uthabiti wa kisiasa, kama vile Uturuki, ilikuwa na utayari mdogo na ilisumbuliwa na visa milioni 12, licha ya kuwa na idadi ya watu milioni 85. Virusi huenea haraka sana kwa sababu ya njia yake ya kuambukizwa kupitia hewa. Ikiwa mtu yuko karibu na mtu aliyeambukizwa, pumzi yake inaweza kubeba virusi na inaweza kuingizwa na watu wenye afya. Kuvaa kinyago na kudumisha umbali husaidia kuzuia watu walioambukizwa kuenea kwa chembe za virusi karibu na watu wenye afya. Hata hivyo, katika nchi ambazo hatua hizo hazikutekelezwa, kulikuwa na ongezeko kubwa la vifo vya kupita kiasi. Tofauti mpya ya omicron inathibitika kuenea kwa kasi zaidi ya mara 20 kuliko aina ya awali kwa sababu ya mabadiliko yake 30 (Grossman na Stahel, 2022). Kwa bahati nzuri, pia ni hatari kidogo kwa sababu haishambulii tishu ya mapafu katika hatua zake za mwanzo (Zimmer na Ghorayshi, 2021). Mtu anaweza pia kuchambua vizuizi vya coronavirus kutoka kwa mtazamo wa maadili: Je, tunapaswa kupunguza hatua za corona hata kama kufanya hivyo kunaweza kuhatarisha maisha zaidi? Kufikia Januari 28, 2021, virusi vya corona vina kiwango cha vifo cha 0.51%. Hii ni ya juu ikilinganishwa na virusi vingine vya kupumua kama vile mafua, ambayo ina kiwango cha vifo cha 0.01%. COVID-19 huathiri kwa kiasi kikubwa makundi yaliyo hatarini, kama vile wale walio na hali ya msingi ya afya kama vile ugonjwa wa kisukari, unene kupita kiasi, au magonjwa ya autoimmune. Hilo ni kweli hasa kwa wazee, kwa sababu ya ongezeko la matatizo ya afya na mfumo wa kinga ambao umedhoofika kwa sababu ya uzee. Virusi vya corona huambukiza njia ya juu ya kupumua, ikiwemo mapafu. Inaingia kwenye chembe na kuziamuru zifanye nakala za virusi. Kisha chembe hiyo hufunguka na kupeleka nakala mpya za virusi kwenye chembe nyingine. Mwishowe, ikiwa hakuna majibu ya kinga yenye ufanisi, mgonjwa atakufa kutokana na uharibifu wa mapafu, haswa na aina za COVID-19 kabla ya aina ya Omicron. Wakati wa kufungwa, kuna mawasiliano madogo ya binadamu, ambayo hupunguza kasi ya kuenea kwa virusi. Hata hivyo, kuzuia mawasiliano ya kijamii kuna matokeo yake yenye kuharibu. Kwa mfano, wakati wa kufungwa kulikuwa na zaidi ya watoto milioni 2.5 walio katika hatari ya kushindwa kujifunza (<unk>Jongeren<unk> 2021') (\"Elimu na COVID-19\", 2022). Kwa kuongezea, kulingana na Huduma ya Afya ya OSF, \"Wastani wa ziara za kila wiki kwenye idara ya dharura kwa majaribio ya kujiua kati ya wasichana wadogo yaliongezeka kwa zaidi ya 50% ikilinganishwa na kipindi kama hicho mwaka mmoja uliopita\" (Huduma ya Afya ya OSF, 2021). Kwa hiyo, hata kama maisha zaidi yanawekwa hatarini, kwa kuchukua hatua za ziada kwa wale walio katika kundi la hatari, mtu anaweza kufungua tena jamii kwa usalama na kuzuia kujiua na matatizo ya kujifunza kwa vijana. Isitoshe, chanjo zinaweza kuzuia uharibifu mkubwa wa tishu usitokee. Kutokana na mtazamo wa jamii, virusi vya corona vimethibitika kuwa \"suala la mgawanyiko\", na kuwasukuma watu fulani kukataa chanjo. Raia wengi wanaepuka kupata chanjo bila kuelewa kabisa matokeo yake. Kuna aina mbili za chanjo: mRNA na virusi. Chanjo ya mRNA ya COVID-19 ilikuwa chanjo ya kwanza ya mRNA kutumika kwa umma kwa ujumla. Chanjo za mRNA zina RNA ndani ya lipidi ambazo husaidia RNA kuingia kwenye seli. Ribosomes husoma RNA na kuagiza seli kutengeneza protini za spike sawa na SARS-CoV-2. Kisha mwili hutambua kwamba protini za Corona spike ni wavamizi na huunda kingamwili za kuziangamiza. Kwa kulinganisha, chanjo za virusi huingiza nakala isiyo na madhara ya virusi yenye DNA ileile ya protini ya spike, na kusababisha mfumo wa kinga kuishambulia na kuikumbuka. Kwa aina zote mbili za chanjo, chembe za B za kumbukumbu zitaendelea kutengeneza kingamwili iwapo mtu ataambukizwa virusi halisi wakati ujao. Kulingana na Dk. Stahel, <unk>Omicron imebadilika kiasi kwamba ina ushirika mdogo katika suala la kingamwili kutoka chanjo inayotambua, kwa hivyo, kwa hivyo, jibu ni risasi ya nyongeza, kwa sababu utalemea virusi na idadi ya majibu ya kinga hata ikiwa hakuna mechi kamili<unk> (Grossman na Stahel, 2022). Hivyo, dozi za awali za chanjo na, hivi karibuni zaidi, dozi za nyongeza zina jukumu muhimu katika kuzuia maambukizo, lakini muhimu zaidi katika kupunguza uwezekano wa ugonjwa mbaya na kifo. Hata hivyo, uchunguzi mpya umeonyesha kwamba kinga yenye matokeo yaweza kutoweka ndani ya miezi sita, ikifanya iwe lazima kupata kipimo cha kila mwaka, sawa na cha mafua (Doucleff). Asilimia 13.6 ya idadi ya watu wenye umri wa zaidi ya miaka 18 hukataa kupatiwa chanjo, hasa kwa sababu ya kutoamini serikali (Vaccinations COVID-19 vaccinations, 2022). Hii inapunguza athari za kinga ya kundi, dhana ambayo ikiwa watu wa kutosha wamechanjwa virusi haitaweza kuenea tena kwa sababu malengo yote ni kinga. Mwishowe, lazima mtu azingatie athari za kiuchumi za kufungwa. Kufungwa kwa nchi kulileta ukosefu mkubwa wa ajira, haswa kwa wale waliofanya kazi katika tasnia ya kusafiri. Kwa mfano, kulingana na jukwaa la uchumi duniani, watu milioni 114 walipoteza kazi zao mwaka 2020 (Richter, 2021). Kwa kuongezea, vifungo duniani kote pia vilisababisha hasara ya takriban euro trilioni 3.2 katika mapato ya kazi. Pamoja na athari mbaya za kiuchumi, lazima mtu azingatie ukweli kwamba maisha yanawekwa hatarini wakati hatua sahihi za corona hazichukuliwe. Kulingana na NPR, kungekuwa na takriban mara 488 ya idadi ya visa nchini China ikiwa hatua za kutosha hazingechukuliwa, na hivyo kuokoa mamilioni ya maisha (Beaubien, 2020). Kwa kumalizia, kwa kuzingatia COVID-19 kutoka kwa lensi ya kisiasa, maadili, kijamii na kiuchumi, ninahitimisha kuwa hata ingawa virusi ni vya kuambukiza sana na vinaua kwa vikundi fulani, kufungwa ni suluhisho la muda tu. Kufunga ni manufaa kwa jamii yetu mara tu kiwango cha vifo kinapoanza kuongezeka. Kwa hiyo, kwa kuchukua hatua mapema, nchi zinaweza kuzuia kuenea kwa virusi hivyo. Kwa mfano, ilichukua miezi sita kabla ya kuvaa barakoa kuonekana kama hatua inayofaa. Kama ilivyoonekana katika kipindi cha kwanza cha kuzuiliwa, makumi ya maelfu ya watu walipoteza kazi zao na zaidi ya watoto milioni 2.5 walilazimika kujifunza kwa mbali nchini Uholanzi (\"Jongeren\", 2021). Kwa hiyo, kwa kuchukua hatua kwa wakati na kuwa tayari, mtu hahitaji kuingia katika kizuizi. Hata hivyo, ikiwa vifo vinaanza kuwa vya kupita kiasi, inafaa kutekeleza kiwango sawa cha hatua za corona.", "output": ". This article is about the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

When someone experiences cold water immersion, their body temperature drops quickly, which can be uncomfortable. The body responds by producing more sweat to try to maintain body temperature. This is a natural process called vasodilation, which allows for increased blood flow to the skin and hair follicles, which in turn increases the body's ability to cool itself. The vasodilation process can also cause a feeling of relaxation and a sense of well-being, as the body is able to release endorphins and other chemicals that can lead to a feeling of calm and happiness.

Wao ni ishara nzuri ya kutokuwa na hatia. Lakini je, umeona kwamba idadi yao inapungua kila mwaka? Nilipokuwa mtoto, huwezi kwenda safari bila kupata vipepeo kwenye kioo cha mbele cha gari lako. Kwa hiyo kwa nini kuna wachache sana na hilo lamaanisha nini?  Mojawapo ya sababu kuu ni matumizi ya dawa za kuua wadudu na magugu. Kemikali hizo huua bila kuchagua. Na huvuruga usawaziko wa mazingira yote. Katika uwanja wangu, nimeona jinsi uvumilivu kidogo unavyoweza kurudisha usawaziko. Nilikuwa na chawa, lakini polepole niliona wadudu wa chawa wakisuluhisha tatizo hilo. Nilikuwa na nzi kwa sababu ya kibanda changu cha kuku, lakini kwa muda wa majuma machache niliona Swallows na Phoebes wakiingia ili kutumia vibaya chanzo cha chakula.  Sababu nyingine inayofanya vipepeo wachache waonekane ni chakula cha chawa. Vipepeo na nondo wengi (au vipepeo wa usiku kama nipendavyo kuwaita) huhitaji mmea fulani hususa kuwa makao ya viwavi wao. Kwa vipepeo wa Monarch, ni Milkweed (Asclepias), ambalo ni jina la kusikitisha kwa mmea maridadi. Kwa Pipevine Swallowtails, ni Pipevine (Aristolochia). Bila mimea hiyo, viwavi hawana chakula. Na majiji na vitongoji vya miji vinapowekwa lami, hakuna mahali ambapo mimea hiyo ambayo wakati mmoja ilikuwa mingi sana inaweza kukua. Tunapotazama mashamba yetu, tunaona mimea maridadi ambayo imeletwa kutoka sehemu nyingine. Lakini kwa kipepeo, viwanja vyetu huonekana kama jangwa. Hata mimea kama vile bottlebrush, ambayo huvutia wadudu wengi kwa ajili ya nekta, haitoi chakula kwa wadudu wachanga wa huko. Ni aina ya kama kuwa na bar kwa ajili ya watu wazima kunywa katika, lakini hakuna chakula kulisha watoto wao ili waweze kukua kuwa watu wazima pia.

Tulipokuwa tukijitayarisha kurekebisha bustani yetu kutoka kwa mimea ya mapambo ya kijani kibichi, hadi kwenye bustani ya Kiingereza ya nyumba ndogo/bustani ya maua yaliyokatwa, jambo fulani lilitokea. Tuliona Doug Tallamy akizungumza katika mkutano wa CNPS Silicon Valley Zoom Meeting. Na tukagundua kwamba tunapaswa kubadili mwelekeo wetu, na kuanza kufanya kazi ya bustani na wenyeji.  Tunapotazama bustani yetu, jambo muhimu ni kwamba tunaanza tu... Ni majaribio makubwa ya kuona kinachofanya kazi wapi. Na tayari bustani inazungumza nasi. Nyasi hiyo yenye macho ya bluu imevuka njia iliyojengwa kwa mawe hadi sehemu nyingine ya bustani! Tunatarajia zaidi ya harakati na uchawi katika siku zijazo. Haya ni baadhi ya mawazo yetu kuhusu bustani yetu.  Baraka... kuwa na mti mkubwa wa mwaloni katika uwanja wetu na kijito nyuma yetu kwa hakika imetupa mguu juu katika suala la chakula na ufikiaji wa wanyamapori kwenye uwanja wetu.  Ubaya ni kwamba kuna kivuli kingi. Ni maeneo mawili tu, labda matatu katika bustani yetu ambayo hupata jua zuri. Kwa hiyo, tunatafuta mimea inayoweza kuvumilia kivuli. (Kama wewe si alikutana Calscape wewe ni katika kwa ajili ya kutibu. Natumaini kuishi katika California ingawa...).  Lengo... kama Talamites, tunaamini katika kulisha mazingira, ambayo huanza na kilimo cha chaza. Kwa hiyo hilo limetendaje? Kwa kweli, tumeona chawa mmoja au wawili tu hadi sasa. Tafakari. Yote ni majaribio...  Athari kubwa... kuacha majani mwaka uliopita. Tayari tunaweza kuona udongo ukiboresha, na kila mara tunaponyunyizia maji tunaona wadudu wengi wakitoka kwenye mchanga. Hivyo ndivyo inavyotukia. Polepole...  Kwa hiyo tunaendelea kubadilisha watu wasiokuwa wenyeji kwa wenyeji.

Kazi ilikamilishwa Agosti 1940, wakati meli hiyo ilipoingizwa katika kikosi cha wanamaji cha Ujerumani. Bismarck na meli yake ya dada Tirpitz ndizo zilikuwa meli kubwa zaidi za kivita zilizowahi kujengwa na Ujerumani, na mbili kati ya zile kubwa zaidi zilizojengwa na serikali yoyote ya Ulaya.  Katika kipindi cha kazi ya meli ya vita ya miezi nane, Bismarck aliendesha operesheni moja tu ya uvamizi ambayo ilidumu siku 8 Mei 1941, jina la siri Rheinübung. Meli hiyo, pamoja na meli nyingine nzito ya kuvuka bahari, Prinz Eugen, iliingia katika Bahari ya Atlantiki na kushambulia meli za Majeshi ya Muungano kutoka Amerika Kaskazini hadi Uingereza. Meli hizo mbili ziligunduliwa mara kadhaa karibu na Skandinavia, na vikosi vya jeshi la wanamaji la Uingereza vilitumwa kuzizuia. Wakati wa vita vya Denmark Strait, meli ya vita ya HMS Hood mwanzoni ilihusika na Prinz Eugen, labda kwa makosa, wakati HMS Prince of Wales ilihusika na Bismarck. Katika mapigano yaliyofuata Hood iliharibiwa na moto wa pamoja wa Bismarck na Prinz Eugen, ambayo kisha kuharibiwa Prince wa Wales na kulazimishwa wake retreat. Bismarck alipata uharibifu wa kutosha kutokana na mashambulizi matatu ya Prince of Wales ili kulazimisha kukomesha uvamizi huo.  Kuharibiwa kwa Hood kulichochea jeshi la Royal Navy lifuatilie meli za vita bila kukoma. Siku mbili baadaye, akiwa njiani kuelekea Ufaransa ili kufanya marekebisho, Bismarck alishambuliwa na ndege kumi na tano za Fairey Swordfish kutoka kwa meli ya kubebea ndege HMS Ark Royal; moja ilipiga risasi ambayo ilifanya gia ya kuongoza ya meli ya kivita isiweze kufanya kazi. Katika mapigano yake ya mwisho asubuhi iliyofuata, meli ya Bismarck, ambayo tayari ilikuwa imeharibika, ilishambuliwa na meli mbili za kivita za Uingereza na meli mbili nzito za kuvuka bahari.

Maandishi ya kale ya Wamisri kutoka 2750 K.W.K. yalirejezea samaki hao kuwa \"Mngurumo wa Nile\", na kuwaeleza kuwa \"walinzi\" wa samaki wengine wote. Samaki wa umeme waliripotiwa tena maelfu ya miaka baadaye na Wagiriki wa kale, Waroma na wataalamu wa asili na madaktari wa Kiarabu. Waandikaji kadhaa wa kale, kama vile Pliny Mzee na Scribonius Largus, walishuhudia athari ya kupooza ya mshtuko wa umeme uliotolewa na samaki - paka wa umeme na miale ya umeme, na walijua kwamba mshtuko huo ungeweza kusafiri pamoja na vitu vinavyoongoza umeme. Wagonjwa wenye magonjwa kama vile jongo au maumivu ya kichwa waliagizwa waguse samaki wenye umeme wakitumaini kwamba mshtuko huo wenye nguvu ungewaponya. Tamaduni za kale karibu na Mediterania zilijua kwamba vitu fulani, kama vile vijiti vya amber, vingeweza kusuguliwa kwa manyoya ya paka ili kuvutia vitu vyepesi kama manyoya. Thales wa Mileto alifanya mfululizo wa uchunguzi juu ya umeme tuli karibu 600 BCE, ambayo aliamini kwamba msuguano alifanya amber sumaku, kinyume na madini kama vile magnetiti, ambayo haja ya rubbing. Thales alikuwa amekosea alipoamini kwamba uvutano huo ulitokana na athari ya sumaku, lakini baadaye sayansi ingethibitisha uhusiano kati ya sumaku na umeme. Kulingana na nadharia yenye ubishi, huenda Waparthia walikuwa na ujuzi wa kuunganisha umeme, kwa kutegemea ugunduzi wa 1936 wa Batri ya Baghdad, ambayo inafanana na seli ya galvanic, ingawa haijulikani ikiwa kifaa hicho kilikuwa cha umeme. Umeme ungedumu kuwa udadisi tu wa kiakili kwa maelfu ya miaka hadi 1600, wakati mwanasayansi Mwingereza William Gilbert alipoandika kitabu De Magnete, ambapo alichunguza kwa uangalifu umeme na sumaku, akitofautisha athari ya umeme wa lodestone na umeme usiobadilika unaotokezwa na kusugua amber. Alitunga neno la Kilatini Jipya la electricus (\"ya amber\" au \"kama amber\", elektron, neno la Kigiriki la \"amber\") kurejelea mali ya kuvutia vitu vidogo baada ya kusuguliwa. Ushirikiano huo ulitokeza maneno ya Kiingereza \"electric\" na \"electricity\", ambayo yalionekana kwa mara ya kwanza katika kitabu cha Thomas Browne cha mwaka wa 1646 kilichoitwa Pseudodoxia Epidemica. Kazi zaidi ilifanywa katika karne ya 17 na mapema karne ya 18 na Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray na C. F. du Fay. Baadaye katika karne ya 18, Benjamin Franklin alifanya utafiti mwingi kuhusu umeme, naye akauza mali zake ili kugharimia kazi yake. Mnamo Juni 1752 anajulikana kuwa aliunganisha ufunguo wa chuma kwenye sehemu ya chini ya kamba ya kite iliyotiwa unyevu na kuruka kite katika anga lililotishwa na dhoruba. Mfululizo wa cheche zilizokuwa zikiruka kutoka kwenye ufunguo hadi nyuma ya mkono wake ulionyesha kwamba kwa kweli umeme ulikuwa wa umeme. Pia alielezea tabia inayoonekana kuwa ya kinyume ya jar ya Leyden kama kifaa cha kuhifadhi kiasi kikubwa cha malipo ya umeme kwa suala la umeme unaojumuisha malipo mazuri na mabaya Mnamo 1775, Hugh Williamson aliripoti mfululizo wa majaribio kwa Royal Society juu ya mshtuko uliotolewa na mwani wa umeme; mwaka huohuo daktari wa upasuaji na mtaalamu wa anatomia John Hunter alielezea muundo wa viungo vya umeme vya samaki. Katika mwaka wa 1791, Luigi Galvani alichapisha uvumbuzi wake wa bioelektromagneti, akithibitisha kwamba umeme ndio njia ambayo chembe za neva hupitisha ishara kwa misuli. Betri ya Alessandro Volta ya mwaka wa 1800, iliyofanyizwa kwa tabaka za zinki na shaba, iliwapa wanasayansi chanzo cha nishati ya umeme chenye kutegemeka zaidi kuliko mashine za umeme zilizotumiwa hapo awali. Kutambuliwa kwa umeme wa sumaku, umoja wa matukio ya umeme na sumaku, ni kwa sababu ya Hans Christian Ørsted na André-Marie Ampère katika 1819-1820. Michael Faraday alivumbua injini ya umeme mwaka wa 1821, naye Georg Ohm akachanganua kwa njia ya hisabati nyaya za umeme mwaka wa 1827. Umeme na sumaku (na mwanga) walikuwa dhahiri wanaohusishwa na James Clerk Maxwell, hasa katika wake \"On Physical Lines of Force\" katika 1861 na 1862.  Ingawa mwanzoni mwa karne ya 19 sayansi ya umeme ilikuwa imefanya maendeleo ya haraka, mwishoni mwa karne ya 19 uhandisi wa umeme ulikuwa umefanya maendeleo makubwa zaidi. Kupitia watu kama Alexander Graham Bell, Ottó Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla na George Westinghouse, umeme uligeuka kutoka udadisi wa kisayansi kuwa chombo muhimu kwa maisha ya kisasa. Mnamo 1887, Heinrich Hertz aligundua kwamba elektroni zilizoangaziwa na nuru ya urujuanimno hutokeza miali ya umeme kwa urahisi zaidi. Mnamo 1905, Albert Einstein alichapisha karatasi iliyoeleza data za majaribio kutoka athari ya umeme wa picha kuwa ni matokeo ya nishati ya nuru inayobebwa katika vifurushi vya kipekee vya kipimo, ikitoa nishati kwa elektroni. Ugunduzi huo uliongoza kwenye mapinduzi ya quantum. Einstein alipewa Tuzo ya Nobeli ya Fizikia mwaka wa 1921 kwa \"ugunduzi wake wa sheria ya athari ya umeme wa picha\". Athari ya umeme wa picha pia hutumiwa katika photocells kama vile inaweza kupatikana katika paneli za jua. Kifaa cha kwanza cha hali ngumu kilikuwa \"kiashiria cha nywele za paka\" kilichotumiwa kwanza katika miaka ya 1900 katika vipokezi vya redio. Wire kama whisker ni kuwekwa kidogo katika kuwasiliana na kioo imara (kama vile kioo germanium) kugundua ishara ya redio na athari kuwasiliana junction. Katika sehemu imara, sasa ni mdogo kwa vipengele imara na misombo engineered hasa kubadili na kuimarisha yake. Mtiririko wa sasa unaweza kueleweka kwa njia mbili: kama elektroni zilizo na malipo hasi, na kama upungufu wa elektroni zilizo na malipo chanya zinazoitwa mashimo. Matoleo haya na mashimo yanaeleweka katika suala la fizikia ya quantum. Vifaa vya ujenzi ni mara nyingi semiconductor kioo. Teknolojia ya elektroni ya hali-ngumu ilianza kutumiwa wakati teknolojia ya transistors ilipoanza kutumiwa. Transistor ya kwanza ya kufanya kazi, transistor ya msingi ya germanium, ilitengenezwa na John Bardeen na Walter Houser Brattain katika Maabara ya Bell mnamo 1947, ikifuatiwa na transistor ya makutano ya bipolar mnamo 1948.", "target": "Kifaa cha kwanza cha hali ngumu kilikuwa \"kiashiria cha nywele za paka\" kilichotumiwa kwanza katika miaka ya 1900 katika vipokezi vya redio.

Kimapokeo, triathlon ni mchezo wa mtu binafsi na kila mwanariadha ni kushindana dhidi ya kozi na saa kwa wakati bora. Kwa hivyo, wanariadha hawaruhusiwi kupokea msaada kutoka kwa mtu mwingine yeyote nje ya mbio, isipokuwa kujitolea kwa misaada iliyoidhinishwa na mbio ambayo inasambaza chakula na maji kwenye kozi.   Eneo la mpito (baiskeli) ya Triathlon ya Hamburg, 2002 Triathlons ni timed katika sehemu tano mfululizo:  kutoka mwanzo wa kuogelea hadi mwanzo wa mpito wa kwanza (wakati wa kuogelea); kutoka mwanzo wa mpito wa kwanza hadi mwisho wa mpito wa kwanza (T1 wakati); kutoka mwanzo wa kuendesha baiskeli hadi mwisho wa sehemu ya kuendesha baiskeli (wakati wa kuendesha baiskeli); kutoka mwanzo wa mpito wa pili hadi mwisho wa mpito wa pili (T2 wakati); hatimaye kutoka mwanzo wa kukimbia hadi mwisho wa kukimbia, wakati ambapo triathlon ni kukamilika. Kwa kawaida matokeo huwekwa kwenye tovuti rasmi na yataonyesha kwa kila mwanariadha wa aina tatu muda wake wa kuogelea; muda wa mzunguko (pamoja na mabadiliko); muda wa kukimbia; na muda wa jumla. Baadhi ya jamii pia huweka nyakati za mpito kando.  Sheria nyingine za triathlon zinatofautiana kutoka mbio hadi mbio na kwa ujumla zinajumuisha maelezo ya vifaa vinavyoruhusiwa (kwa mfano, nguo za maji zinazoruhusiwa katika hafla za USAT katika hatua ya kuogelea ya mbio zingine wakati joto la maji liko chini ya 25.6 ° C (78.1 ° F)), na marufuku dhidi ya kuingiliana kati ya wanariadha. Kwa kuongezea, matumizi ya mabawa ya kuogelea au vifaa vingine vya kuogelea na kusaidia kuelea ni kinyume cha sheria katika mashindano ya mbio tatu na yaweza kusababisha kutostahili.  Sheria moja inayohusisha mguu wa baiskeli ni kwamba kofia ya mgombea lazima iwekwe kabla ya mgombea kupanda (au hata kuchukua milki, katika mamlaka fulani) ya baiskeli, na lazima ibaki hadi mgombea atakaposhuka; mgombea hawezi kuhitajika kuvaa kofia wakati hayuko kwenye baiskeli (kwa mfano wakati wa kurekebisha shida ya mitambo). Kukosa kutii sheria hii kutasababisha kutostahili. Kwa kuongezea, wakati wa mbio za baiskeli, baiskeli zote lazima ziendeshwe tu na nguvu na nguvu ya kibinadamu. Mbali na kusukuma baiskeli, hatua yoyote ya propulsive kuletwa na matumizi ya mikono ni marufuku. Ikiwa baiskeli ya mshindani itaharibika, wanaweza kuendelea na mbio mradi tu wanafanya hivyo wakiwa na baiskeli yao. Pia kuna sheria kali kuhusu mstari wa 'kuweka baiskeli.' Washindani hawawezi kuanza kuendesha baiskeli zao nje ya mpito mpaka wawe juu ya mstari uliowekwa wazi. Kupanda baiskeli kabla ya hii inaweza kusababisha adhabu (mfano: adhabu ya muda wa sekunde 15 katika Olimpiki ya London 2012 ilitolewa kwa Jonathan Brownlee, mshindani kutoka Uingereza, kwa kupanda baiskeli yake mapema sana.)  Adhabu nyingine za muda zinaweza kutolewa wakati wa mashindano, miongoni mwa mambo mengine, kwa kuchora baiskeli katika mbio zisizo za kuchora, kupitisha vibaya, kutupa takataka kwenye kozi, na tabia isiyo ya michezo.", "target": "Mashindano ya mbio tatu za masafa marefu hufanywa kwa vipindi vitano.

{"model_name": "wenge-research/yayi-7b", "input": "Dondoo majina ya washawishi juu ya mashairi ya Ruben Dario\nContext:Shairi la Kifaransa lilikuwa na uvutano mkubwa katika malezi ya Darío kama mshairi. Kwanza, wapenzi wa kimapenzi, hasa Victor Hugo. Baadaye, Darío aliathiriwa sana na wafuasi wa Parnassian: Théophile Gautier, Catulle Mendès, na José María de Heredia. Mwandikaji mwingine wa mashairi na mashairi na shujaa wa kitaifa wa Kuba, Jose Martí, alikuwa na uvutano mkubwa. Kipengele cha mwisho cha kufafanua aesthetic ya Darianian ni pongezi yake kwa Waashiria, haswa Paul Verlaine. Akirudia mtiririko wake mwenyewe wa kishairi katika shairi la awali la Cantos de vida y esperanza (1905) Darío mwenyewe aliunganisha ushawishi wake kuu wakati akithibitisha kuwa alikuwa \"mwenye nguvu na Hugo na mwenye utata na Verlaine\" (\"con Hugo fuerte y con Verlaine ambiguo\".)  Katika sehemu ya \"Palabras Liminares\" ya Prosas Profanas (1896) alikuwa tayari ameandika aya ambayo inaonyesha umuhimu wa utamaduni wa Ufaransa katika maendeleo ya kazi yake ya fasihi:  Mhispania huyo mzee mwenye ndevu nyeupe anaelekeza kidole chake kwa mfululizo wa picha zenye kuvutia: \"Huyu - anasema - ni Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra mkuu, mjuzi mwenye mkono mmoja; huyu ni Lope de Vega, huyu ni Garcilaso, huyu ni Quintana\". Ninamwomba kwa ajili ya mtu mtukufu Gracián, kwa ajili ya Teresa wa Ávila, kwa ajili ya Góngora mwenye ujasiri na mwenye nguvu zaidi ya wote, Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas. Kisha nasema: \"Shakespeare! Dante! Hugo...! (na katika kichwa changu: Verlaine...!) \" Kisha, wakati wa kusema kwaheri: \"-Mzee, ni muhimu kusema: mke wangu ni kutoka nchi yangu; mpenzi wangu ni kutoka Paris\".  Los raros ni kitabu cha kuelezea kuhusu ladha ya fasihi, ambayo alichapisha mwaka huo huo kama Prosas profanas, na kujitolea kwa ufupi gloss baadhi ya waandishi na wasomi ambao alihisi admiration kina. Miongoni mwa wale katika kitabu tunapata Edgar Allan Poe, Villiers de l'Isle Adam, Léon Bloy, Paul Verlaine, Lautréamont, Eugénio de Castro na José Martí (mwisho kuwa mmoja tu zilizotajwa ambaye aliandika kazi yao ya fasihi katika Kihispania). Utamaduni wa Ufaransa unaonekana waziwazi. Darío aliandika hivi: \"Utamaduni wa kisasa si kitu kingine ila shairi la Kihispania na shairi la Kifaransa lililochunguzwa kwa uangalifu na shairi zuri la Kifaransa\". Akiacha kando hatua yake ya mwanzo, kabla ya Azul..., ambapo mashairi yake yana deni kubwa kwa majina makubwa ya mashairi ya Uhispania ya karne ya 19, kama vile Núñez de Arce na Campoamor, Darío alikuwa mshauri mkubwa wa Bécquer. Mandhari za Kihispania zinawakilishwa vizuri katika kazi yake, tayari katika Prosas profanas na, haswa, baada ya safari yake ya pili kwenda Uhispania, mnamo 1899.

{"model_name": "wenge-research/yayi-7b", "input": "Muhtasari historia ya NATO\nContext:Mkataba wa Dunkirk ulisainiwa na Ufaransa na Uingereza mnamo 4 Machi 1947, wakati wa baada ya Vita vya Kidunia vya pili na mwanzo wa Vita Baridi, kama Mkataba wa Ushirikiano na Msaada wa Pamoja ikiwa kuna uwezekano wa mashambulizi ya Ujerumani au Urusi. Mnamo Machi 1948, muungano huo ulipanuliwa katika Mkataba wa Brussels ili kutia ndani nchi za Benelux, zikifanyiza Shirika la Mkataba wa Brussels, linalojulikana kama Western Union. Mazungumzo kwa ajili ya ushirikiano wa kijeshi pana, ambayo inaweza ni pamoja na Amerika ya Kaskazini, pia ilianza mwezi huo katika Marekani, ambapo sera zao za kigeni chini ya Truman Doctrine kukuzwa mshikamano wa kimataifa dhidi ya vitendo waliona kama uchokozi wa kikomunisti, kama vile Februari 1948 mapinduzi ya serikali katika Chekoslovakia. Mazungumzo hayo yaliongoza kwenye kutiwa sahihi kwa Mkataba wa Atlantiki ya Kaskazini mnamo Aprili 4, 1949 na nchi wanachama wa Muungano wa Magharibi pamoja na Marekani, Kanada, Ureno, Italia, Norway, Denmark, na Iceland. Mwanadiplomasia Mkanada Lester B. Pearson alikuwa mwandishi mkuu na mtungaji wa mkataba huo.  Chumba kirefu chenye umbo la mstatili chenye safu nyingi za watu walioketi kila upande, na bendera zilizoning'inia kwenye mwisho wa mbali. Ujerumani Magharibi ilijiunga na NATO mwaka wa 1955, jambo lililoongoza kwenye kuanzishwa kwa Muungano wa Warsaw wakati wa Vita Baridi. Mkataba wa Atlantiki ya Kaskazini ulikuwa haufanyi kazi hadi Vita vya Korea vilipoanzisha kuanzishwa kwa NATO ili kuutekeleza kwa muundo wa kijeshi uliounganishwa. Hii ni pamoja na kuundwa kwa Mkuu Mkuu Mkuu wa Allied Powers Ulaya (SHAPE) mwaka 1951, ambayo ilipitisha miundo na mipango mingi ya kijeshi ya Umoja wa Magharibi, ikiwa ni pamoja na makubaliano yao juu ya kuimarisha vifaa na makubaliano juu ya kuweka vikosi vya kijeshi vya kigeni katika nchi za Ulaya. Katika mwaka wa 1952, cheo cha Katibu Mkuu wa NATO kilianzishwa kuwa cheo cha juu cha raia wa shirika hilo. Mwaka huo pia uliona mazoezi ya kwanza ya bahari ya NATO, Mazoezi ya Mainbrace na kujiunga kwa Ugiriki na Uturuki kwa shirika hilo. Kufuatia Mikutano ya London na Paris, Ujerumani Magharibi iliruhusiwa kujihami kijeshi, walipojiunga na NATO mnamo Mei 1955, ambayo ilikuwa, kwa upande wake, sababu kuu ya kuundwa kwa Mkataba wa Warsaw uliodhibitiwa na Urusi, kuelezea pande mbili zinazopingana za Vita Baridi.  Ujenzi wa ukuta wa Berlin mwaka 1961 uliashiria kilele cha mvutano wa Vita Baridi, wakati wanajeshi 400,000 wa Marekani walipokuwa wakisimama Ulaya. Shaka juu ya nguvu ya uhusiano kati ya mataifa ya Ulaya na Marekani ebbed na mtiririko, pamoja na mashaka juu ya uaminifu wa ulinzi wa NATO dhidi ya uvamizi wa Soviet kutarajia - mashaka ambayo yalisababisha maendeleo ya kujitegemea Kifaransa kuzuia nyuklia na uondoaji wa Ufaransa kutoka muundo wa kijeshi wa NATO katika 1966. Katika 1982, Hispania iliyokuwa imepata demokrasia karibuni ilijiunga na muungano huo.  Mapinduzi ya 1989 huko Ulaya yalisababisha tathmini mpya ya kimkakati ya kusudi la NATO, asili, kazi, na kuzingatia bara. Mnamo Oktoba 1990, Ujerumani Mashariki ikawa sehemu ya Jamhuri ya Muungano wa Ujerumani na muungano, na mnamo Novemba 1990, muungano ulitia saini Mkataba juu ya Vikosi vya Silaha vya Kawaida huko Ulaya (CFE) huko Paris na Urusi. Iliamuru upunguzaji maalum wa kijeshi katika bara lote, ambayo iliendelea baada ya kuanguka kwa Mkataba wa Warsaw mnamo Februari 1991 na kuachana kwa Umoja wa Kisovyeti Desemba hiyo hiyo, ambayo iliondoa wapinzani wakuu wa NATO. Hilo lilianza kupunguza matumizi ya kijeshi na vifaa vya kijeshi katika Ulaya. Mkataba wa CFE uliwaruhusu wanachama kuondoa silaha 52,000 za kawaida katika miaka kumi na sita iliyofuata, na kuruhusu matumizi ya kijeshi ya wanachama wa Ulaya wa NATO kupungua kwa asilimia 28 kutoka 1990 hadi 2015. Katika 1990 uhakikisho ulitolewa na viongozi kadhaa wa Magharibi kwa Mikhail Gorbachev kwamba NATO haingepanuka zaidi mashariki, kama ilivyofunuliwa na kumbukumbu za mazungumzo ya kibinafsi. Hata hivyo, andiko la mwisho la Mkataba wa Mkataba wa Mwisho Kuhusu Ujerumani, uliotiwa sahihi baadaye mwaka huo, halikutaja kamwe suala la kupanuka kuelekea mashariki.  Sehemu mbili za juu za saruji ya ukuta katika lawn nyasi mbele ya jengo curved na madirisha bluu-glasi. Kuanguka kwa Ukuta wa Berlin mwaka wa 1989 kulikuwa na badiliko kubwa katika daraka la NATO huko Ulaya, na sasa sehemu hii ya ukuta huo imewekwa nje ya makao makuu ya NATO. Katika miaka ya 1990, shirika hilo lilipanua shughuli zake katika hali za kisiasa na kibinadamu ambazo hapo awali hazikuwa wasiwasi wa NATO. Wakati wa Kuvunjika kwa Yugoslavia, shirika hilo lilifanya uingiliaji wake wa kwanza wa kijeshi huko Bosnia kutoka 1992 hadi 1995 na baadaye Yugoslavia mnamo 1999. Mapigano haya yalisababisha marekebisho makubwa ya kijeshi baada ya Vita Baridi. Muundo wa kijeshi wa NATO ulipunguzwa na kurekebishwa, na vikosi vipya kama vile makao makuu ya Allied Command Ulaya Rapid Reaction Corps ilianzishwa.  Kisiasa, shirika hilo lilitafuta mahusiano bora na nchi mpya za Ulaya ya Kati na Mashariki zilizojitegemea, na vikao vya kidiplomasia vya ushirikiano wa kikanda kati ya NATO na majirani zake vilianzishwa katika kipindi hiki cha baada ya Vita Baridi, ikiwa ni pamoja na Ushirikiano wa Amani na mpango wa Mazungumzo ya Mediterranean mnamo 1994, Baraza la Ushirikiano la Euro-Atlantiki mnamo 1997, na Baraza la Pamoja la Kudumu la NATO-Urusi mnamo 1998. Kwenye mkutano wa Washington wa mwaka wa 1999, Hungaria, Poland, na Jamhuri ya Cheki zilijiunga rasmi na NATO, na shirika hilo pia lilitangaza miongozo mipya ya kujiunga na \"Mipango ya Hatua ya Uanachama\" iliyofanywa kwa ajili ya kila mtu. Mipango hiyo iliongoza kuongezwa kwa washiriki wapya wa muungano huo. Uchaguzi wa Rais wa Ufaransa Nicolas Sarkozy mwaka 2007 ulisababisha mageuzi makubwa ya msimamo wa kijeshi wa Ufaransa, ulimalizika kwa kurudi kwa uanachama kamili tarehe 4 Aprili 2009, ambayo pia ilijumuisha Ufaransa kurudi kwa Muundo wa Uongozi wa Kijeshi wa NATO, wakati wa kudumisha kichocheo cha nyuklia huru.  Kifungu cha 5 cha mkataba wa Atlantiki Kaskazini, kinachohitaji nchi wanachama kusaidia nchi yoyote wanachama inayokabiliwa na shambulio la silaha, kilitumiwa kwa mara ya kwanza na pekee baada ya mashambulizi ya Septemba 11, baada ya majeshi kupelekwa Afghanistan chini ya ISAF inayoongozwa na NATO. Shirika hilo limekuwa likifanya kazi mbalimbali za ziada tangu wakati huo, ikiwa ni pamoja na kutuma walimu kwenda Iraq, kusaidia katika shughuli za kupambana na uharamia, na mwaka 2011 kutekeleza eneo la kukomesha ndege juu ya Libya kwa mujibu wa Azimio la Baraza la Usalama la Umoja wa Mataifa 1973.  Kuunganishwa kwa Crimea na Urusi kulisababisha kukosolewa kwa nguvu na wanachama wote wa NATO, na ilikuwa moja ya mara saba ambazo Ibara ya 4, ambayo inataka mashauriano kati ya wanachama wa NATO, imetumika. Nyakati za awali zilijumuisha wakati wa Vita vya Iraq na Vita vya wenyewe kwa wenyewe vya Syria. Katika mkutano wa kilele wa Wales wa 2014, viongozi wa nchi wanachama wa NATO waliahidi rasmi kwa mara ya kwanza kutumia angalau sawa na asilimia mbili ya bidhaa zao za ndani kwa ulinzi kufikia 2024, ambayo hapo awali ilikuwa mwongozo usio rasmi tu. Katika mkutano wa kilele wa Warsaw wa mwaka 2016, nchi za NATO zilikubaliana kuunda Kikosi cha NATO cha Enhanced Forward Presence, ambacho kilituma vikundi vinne vya kimataifa vya vita vya ukubwa wa batalion huko Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, na Poland. Kabla na wakati wa uvamizi wa Urusi wa 2022 wa Ukraine, nchi kadhaa za NATO zilituma vikosi vya ardhi, meli za kivita na ndege za kivita kuimarisha ukingo wa mashariki wa muungano, na nchi nyingi tena zilitumia Kifungu cha 4. Mnamo Machi 2022, viongozi wa NATO walikutana huko Brussels kwa mkutano wa kilele usio wa kawaida ambao pia ulihusisha viongozi wa Kundi la Saba na Umoja wa Ulaya. Nchi wanachama wa NATO walikubaliana kuanzisha vikundi vinne vya ziada vya vita nchini Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, na Slovakia, na sehemu za Kikosi cha Kujibu cha NATO zilianzishwa kwa mara ya kwanza katika historia ya NATO.  Kufikia Juni 2022, NATO ilikuwa imepeleka wanajeshi 40,000 katika ukingo wake wa mashariki wenye urefu wa kilomita 2,500 ili kuzuia uvamizi wa Urusi. Zaidi ya nusu ya idadi hiyo wametumwa katika Bulgaria, Rumania, Hungaria, Slovakia, na Poland, ambazo nchi tano hukusanya pamoja jeshi kubwa la pamoja la zamani la NATO la askari 259,000. Ili kuongezea Jeshi la Anga la Bulgaria, Hispania ilituma Eurofighter Typhoons, Uholanzi ilituma ndege nane za kushambulia za F-35, na ndege za ziada za kushambulia za Ufaransa na Marekani zingewasili hivi karibuni pia.

Katika mwaka wa 1949, nchi za Marekani, Ubelgiji, Uholanzi, Luxemburg, Ufaransa, Uingereza, Kanada, Ureno, Italia, Norway, Denmark, na Iceland zilikuwa washiriki wa shirika hilo.
