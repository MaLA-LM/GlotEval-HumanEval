Există o serie de factori care alcătuiesc profilul de aromă al unei beri, iar o parte din plăcerea de a-ți prepara propria bere acasă este că poți să te joci cu fiecare dintre aceștia pentru a schimba aroma și caracterul berii tale de casă. Iată cinci modalități prin care vă puteți schimba propria rețetă de bere de casă pentru a adăuga arome interesante sau, alternativ, puteți modifica o rețetă de bere de casă existentă împărtășită de altcineva sau de o fabrică de bere.  1. Folosiţi lămâie diferită. Există o mare varietate de hamei disponibile pentru producătorii de bere la domiciliu, iar fiecare dintre acestea poate introduce în bere o aromă şi un gust proprii, variind de la ananas şi caise, până la pini şi pădure, până la miez de grepfrut şi coajă de lămâie. Folosind în reţetă un hamei diferit, fie din aceeaşi familie de hamei, fie dintr-o familie de hamei cu totul diferită, puteţi adăuga cu uşurinţă modificări interesante şi adesea radicale profilului aromatic al berii dumneavoastră. Cu toate acestea, în funcție de momentul adăugării hameiului în procesul de preparare a berii, puteți, de asemenea, să creșteți/scădeați nivelul de amărăciune al berii, datorită diferitelor soiuri de hamei care au niveluri diferite de acizi alfa.  2. a) Foloseşte o altă drojdie. În afară de fermentarea berii, drojdia lasă în urmă multe arome interesante şi poate da berei tale un caracter subtil. De exemplu, tulpinile de drojdie engleze pot adăuga arome de malț și dulci, drojdia din California tinde să creeze o bere curată și crocantă, în timp ce drojdia de sezon adaugă arome strălucitoare și fructuoase la berea ta.  3. în cazul în care Folosiţi grâne diferite. Schimbarea cantităţii de malţi poate creşte sau scădea alcoolul din berea gata.

Poţi să te joci şi cu boabele speciale, ca şi cum ai folosi o friptură puţin mai întunecată.  4. Se adaugă fructe, condimente sau ierburi Fructele, condimentele, ierburile şi alte ingrediente sunt o modalitate excelentă de a adăuga un caracter personal băuturii dumneavoastră. Orice, de la căpşuni proaspete şi busuioc până la fasole de vanilie şi cardamom, poate completa cu adevărat celelalte arome de malţ şi hamei dintr-o bere.  Cinci. Modifică profilul apei. Stilurile diferite de bere se obțin cel mai bine cu un profil de apă adecvat, cu niveluri diferite de minerale pentru a obține profilul de aromă dorit.

Mai puține cilindri sunt de obicei mai ieftine, fac motocicleta mai ușoară și, prin urmare, mai ușoară de manevrat. Mai multe cilindri fac motorul să se simtă mai neted, au, de asemenea, mai multă putere, dar sunt mai grele și mai scumpe. - Pentru ce îl foloseşti? Doar pentru distracţie, naveta la serviciu, transportul general? Călătorie? În afara drumului? Curse? - Sisteme de asistenţă: motocicletele moderne au o gamă largă de sisteme de asistenţă, cum ar fi ABS, controlul vitezei, senzori de distanţă, moduri electronice de conducere pentru diferite condiţii meteorologice etc. Acestea pot face condusul mai sigur, dar, de asemenea, adaugă greutate şi fac motocicleta mai scumpă. De care ai nevoie? - Stil: Există diferite stiluri cum ar fi naked bike, cruiser, chopper, dual sport, race bike, scrambler etc. Diferite stiluri pot fi mai mult sau mai puțin adecvate în funcție de utilizarea dvs., sau pur și simplu puteți alege cel care vă atrage. - Dimensiune: cele mai importante două aspecte în ceea ce privește dimensiunea sunt înălțimea și greutatea scaunului. Ambele au un impact imens asupra modului în care vă controlaţi situaţia atunci când nu conduceţi, de exemplu atunci când trebuie să vă opriţi la semafor sau să mergeţi încet în traficul stop-and-go. Înălţimea scaunului este importantă, astfel încât picioarele să poată atinge solul atunci când se opreşte.

În copilărie (Ava Potter), Aloy obține un Focus, un dispozitiv de realitate augmentată care îi conferă abilități perceptive speciale. Aloy devine curioasă în legătură cu originile ei și i se spune de către Rost că, dacă câștigă Proving, o competiție pentru a câștiga dreptul de a deveni membru al Nora, Matriarhii tribului ar putea ceda această informație. Aloy își petrece câțiva ani antrenându-se în luptă și supraviețuire sub instrucțiunile lui Rost. După ce a ajuns la vârstă, Aloy participă la Proving; ea câștigă competiția, dar cultistii mascați atacă Nora. Rost se sacrifică pentru a-l salva pe Aloy de liderul lor, Helis (Crispin Freeman). Când Aloy se trezește, Matriarhii explică că Aloy a fost găsită ca un bebeluș în fața unei uși sigilate în muntele sacru al Nora și că aceste origini suspecte au fost motivul pentru care ea a fost o proscrisă. Matriarhii o numesc pe Aloy o \"Căutătoare\", permițându-i să-și părăsească pământurile în urmărirea cultului.

Aloy localizează campusul corporativ ruinat al Faro Automated Solutions și descoperă că Lumea Veche a fost distrusă acum aproape o mie de ani după ce Faro a pierdut controlul asupra roboților militari automatizați de menținere a păcii. Roboţii, care se puteau auto-replica şi consumau biomasă, au invadat planeta şi au înghiţit biosfera, dezbrăcând Pământul de viaţă.

A cauzat pagube de 550 de milioane de dolari în Chile, în timp ce tsunami-ul care a generat a cauzat decese și pagube atât de departe ca Hawaii, Japonia și Filipine. \"Zona de ruptură\" a cutremurului a fost de peste 1000 km lungime. La două zile după cutremurul inițial, vulcanul Puyehue din apropiere a erupt, trimitând cenușă și abur până la 6 km în atmosferă pe o perioadă de câteva săptămâni.  2. a) Prințul William Sound, Alaska 28 martie 1964 (magnitudine 9,2) Comparativ cu cutremurul din Chile, acest cutremur a fost mai puțin dăunător: tsunami-ul rezultat a luat 128 de vieți și a cauzat daune totale de 311 de milioane de dolari. Cutremurul a fost simțit în principal în Alaska, precum și în unele locuri din Canada, în timp ce tsunami-ul creat de acesta a provocat daune până în Hawaii. Cea mai mare pagubă a fost suferită de orașul Anchorage, la 120 km nord-vest de epicentru. S-a raportat că tremurările din cauza cutremurului au durat trei minute.  3. în cazul în care Sumatra, Indonezia 26 decembrie 2004 (magnitudine 9.1) În ceea ce privește daunele și pierderile de vieți, amploarea dezastrului cauzat de tsunami-ul de Boxing Day a fost enormă. În total, 227.900 de persoane au fost ucise sau presupuse moarte, cu aproximativ 1,7 milioane de persoane strămutate în 14 țări din Asia de Sud și Africa de Est. Epicentrul a fost la 250 km sud-est de Band Aceh, Indonezia, la o adâncime de 30 km. Câteva zile mai târziu, pe 28 decembrie, un vulcan de noroi a început să erupă lângă Baratang, Insulele Andamar, care se crede că a fost asociat cu cutremurul.  4. Sendai, Japonia 11 martie 2011 (magnitudine 9,0) Până acum, numărul oficial de decese se ridică la câteva mii din cauza efectului combinat al puternicului cutremur, replicelor şi tsunami-ului. Cu toate acestea, numărul total este de așteptat să crească, unele estimări fiind de peste 10.000. Impactul economic va fi uriaş, cu închiderea reactoarelor nucleare de care multe industrii se bazează pentru energie.  5. Nu. Kamchatka, Rusia 4 noiembrie 1952 (magnitudine 9.0) Acest cutremur a generat un tsunami care a cauzat pagube masive în insulele Hawaii.

Peste 800.000 de persoane au fost strămutate, cu un total de 1,8 milioane de persoane afectate în Chile, unde daunele au fost estimate la 30 de miliarde de dolari. Epicentrul a fost la 335 km sud-vest de Santiago, la o adâncime de 35 km. Un tsunami minor a traversat Pacificul cauzând daune la bărci din San Diego, California.  7. În largul coastei Ecuadorului 31 ianuarie 1906 (magnitudine 8,8) Acest cutremur a provocat un tsunami care, potrivit rapoartelor, a ucis între 500 şi 1.500 de persoane în Ecuador şi Columbia. Tsunamiul a călătorit spre nord până la San Francisco, pe coasta de vest a SUA, și spre vest până la Hawaii și Japonia. Tsunami-ului i-a luat aproximativ 12 ore să traverseze Pacificul până la Hilo, Hawaii.  8. Insulele Rat, Alaska 2 aprilie 1965 (magnitudine 8.7) Cele mai mari daune atribuite acestui cutremur au fost cauzate de un tsunami, raportat a fi de aproximativ 10 m înălțime pe insula Shemya. Valul a provocat inundații pe insula Amchitka, provocând daune materiale de 10.000 de dolari. Nu au fost raportate victime sau răniţi.  9. Sumatra, Indonezia 28 martie 2005 (magnitudine 8,6) Acest cutremur a ucis 1313, cu peste 400 de persoane rănite de tsunami până în Sri Lanka. Epicentrul a fost la 205 km nord-vest de Sibolga, Sumatra, la o adâncime de 30 km.

Guvernele comuniste au fost instalate în statele satelit ale Blocului Estic. După ce a devenit a doua putere nucleară din lume, Uniunea Sovietică a înființat alianța Pactului de la Varșovia și a intrat într-o luptă pentru dominație globală, cunoscută sub numele de Războiul Rece, cu Statele Unite și NATO. După moartea lui Stalin în 1953 și o scurtă perioadă de guvernare colectivă, noul lider Nikita Hrușciov l-a denunțat pe Stalin și a lansat politica de destalinizare, eliberând mulți prizonieri politici din lagărele de muncă din Gulag. Încetinirea generală a politicilor represive a devenit cunoscută mai târziu ca \"dezghețarea lui Hrușciov\". În același timp, tensiunile din Războiul Rece au atins apogeul când cei doi rivali s-au ciocnit cu privire la desfășurarea rachetelor Jupiter ale Statelor Unite în Turcia și a rachetelor sovietice în Cuba.  În 1957, Uniunea Sovietică a lansat primul satelit artificial din lume, Sputnik 1, începând astfel Era Spațială. Cosmonautul rus Iuri Gagarin a devenit primul om care a orbitat Pământul, la bordul navei spațiale Vostok 1 la 12 aprilie 1961. După înlăturarea lui Hrușciov în 1964, a urmat o altă perioadă de guvernare colectivă, până când Leonid Brejnev a devenit lider. Era anilor 1970 și începutul anilor 1980 a fost mai târziu desemnată ca Era Stagnării. Reforma Kosygin din 1965 a vizat descentralizarea parțială a economiei sovietice. În 1979, după o revoluție condusă de comuniști în Afganistan, forțele sovietice au invadat țara, începând în cele din urmă războiul sovietic-afgan. În mai 1988, sovieticii au început să se retragă din Afganistan, din cauza opoziției internaționale, a războiului de gherilă anti-sovietic persistent și a lipsei de sprijin din partea cetățenilor sovietici.  Începând cu 1985, ultimul lider sovietic Mihail Gorbaciov, care a căutat să adopte reforme liberale în sistemul sovietic, a introdus politicile de glasnost (deschidere) și perestroika (restructurare) în încercarea de a pune capăt perioadei de stagnare economică și de a democratiza guvernul. Acest lucru, totuși, a dus la creșterea puternic naționalist și separatist mișcări în întreaga țară. Înainte de 1991, economia sovietică a fost a doua cea mai mare din lume, dar în ultimii ani ai ei, a intrat în criză.  În 1991, tulburările economice şi politice au început să se agite, deoarece statele baltice au ales să se separe de Uniunea Sovietică. La 17 martie, a avut loc un referendum, în care marea majoritate a cetățenilor participanți au votat în favoarea transformării Uniunii Sovietice într-o federație reînnoită. În iunie 1991, Boris Elțîn a devenit primul președinte ales direct în istoria Rusiei când a fost ales președinte al RSFSR. În august 1991, o tentativă de lovitură de stat a membrilor guvernului lui Gorbaciov, îndreptată împotriva lui Gorbaciov și menită să păstreze Uniunea Sovietică, a dus în schimb la sfârșitul Partidului Comunist al Uniunii Sovietice.

După moartea lui Stalin în 1953 și o scurtă perioadă de guvernare colectivă, noul lider Nikita Hrușciov l-a denunțat pe Stalin și a lansat politica de destalinizare, eliberând mulți prizonieri politici din lagărele de muncă din Gulag.

M-am gândit mult la asta şi am făcut multe cercetări despre ce ar putea fi implicat. Sunt conştientă că a avea un animal de companie este un angajament uriaş, aşa că îţi scriu să-ţi explic de ce cred că ar trebui să-mi cumperi o ţestoasă de companie şi de ce o ţestoasă este o alegere fantastică de animal de companie.  Să am grijă de o broască ţestoasă îmi va da un puternic simţ al responsabilităţii. Ştiu că va trebui să mă asigur că ţestoasa mea e bine hrănită, ţinută la temperatura potrivită, şi că are ocazia să se bucure de soare sub o lampă încălzită sau la soare dacă e destul de cald. Sunt foarte dispus să-mi dedic timpul şi angajamentul necesar pentru a avea grijă de ţestoasa mea. Ţestoasa va fi responsabilitatea mea şi mă simt destul de matur să mă angajez în îngrijirea şi fericirea ei.  După cum ştii, sufăr de anxietate şi şcoala mă îngrijorează uneori. S-a demonstrat prin numeroase studii că animalele de companie reduc anxietatea și stresul la oameni. Sunt sigur că având o broască ţestoasă va fi o distragere fantastică de la grijile mele şi îmi va aduce o mare plăcere. Contrar credinţei populare, ţestoaselor le place să le fie mângâiate cochiliile şi să le fie gâdilat bărbia şi cred că ar fi foarte relaxant pentru mine să mângâi o ţestoasă când vin acasă de la şcoală.  Ţestoasele sunt foarte autosuficiente. Cu condiţia să li se acorde un loc cald în care să se potolească, acces la apă proaspătă şi o mulţime de alimente proaspete, cum ar fi păpădie, varză verde, salată şi alte legume cu frunze, sunt foarte fericiţi să fie lăsaţi pe cont propriu. Deoarece trăim în Marea Britanie, unde temperaturile pot fi reci, ar trebui să cumpărăm o masă pentru ţestoase cu un substrat bun, o lampă de căldură şi nişte piei în care ţestoasa se poate ascunde. Avem destul loc pentru asta în bucătărie. Când e cald, ţestoasa poate intra în grădina noastră într-un adăpost. O masă cu ţestoase şi o lampă vor costa aproximativ 200 de lire, dar asta e doar o cheltuială iniţială. După aceea, păstrarea unei ţestoase e foarte ieftină. De fapt, poţi să le culegi mâncarea gratuit, căutând hrană, ceea ce eu fac cu plăcere când mergem la plimbare în familie.  Contrar credinţei populare, ţestoasele pot fi foarte prietenoase. După cum am menţionat mai sus, le place să fie mângâiate, dar ştiai că îşi pot recunoaşte stăpânii şi unii pot chiar să răspundă la numele lor? De fapt, un studiu a arătat că ţestoasele îşi pot recunoaşte proprietarii anteriori pe care nu i-au văzut de ani de zile, aşa că sunt atât prietenoase cât şi foarte inteligente. S-ar putea să-ţi faci griji că o ţestoasă hibernează, dar am făcut o mulţime de cercetări şi acum ştiu exact ce să fac. Dacă cumpărăm o broască ţestoasă, va trebui să hiberneze maximum trei luni de la sfârşitul lui septembrie. Va trebui să hibernăm ţestoasa într-o cutie bine izolată. Temperatura nu trebuie să depăşească sau să scadă sub 5 grade Celsius şi garajul nostru ar fi locul perfect pentru asta. Avem un aparat de măsurare a temperaturii acolo ca să pot urmări nivelul de căldură.  În cele din urmă, m-am uitat în costul de a cumpăra o broască ţestoasă. Aş sugera să cumpărăm o broască ţestoasă care are câţiva ani, pentru că are nevoie de mai puţină îngrijire. Putem cumpăra o broască ţestoasă care a fost microcipată pentru aproximativ 100 de lire. Şi când vom merge în vacanţă, am găsit un Hotel Ţestoasă care este condus de un veterinar şi costă doar 60 de lire pentru o şedere de 10 zile.  Cred că vei fi de acord că am făcut o cercetare foarte amănunţită în îngrijirea unei ţestoase şi sper că vei fi de acord că acum sunt destul de matură să am grijă de un animal de companie. Cred cu adevărat că o broască ţestoasă de companie îmi va da un puternic simţ al responsabilităţii şi va avea un efect calmant pozitiv asupra dispoziţiei mele. De fapt, cred că întreaga familie se va bucura de o broască ţestoasă. Sunt animale prietenoase, iubitoare, interesante şi inteligente şi toţi vom beneficia de a avea unul.

{"model_name": "wenge-research/yayi-7b", "input": "Scrie un eseu despre măsurile politicii privind corona sunt benefice pentru societate sau nu", "target": "După aproape doi ani de pandemie COVID-19 și încă o închidere, mulți oameni din Olanda sunt din ce în ce mai neliniștiți și sătui de restricții. Potrivit Rijksoverheid, un număr record de 74.000 de cazuri au fost confirmate în Olanda pe 28 ianuarie, cu doar zece admiteri sau decese legate de corona la terapie intensivă (<unk>Infecții - cazuri confirmate<unk>, 2022). Acest lucru ridică dezbaterea: ar trebui guvernul să continue să pună în aplicare aceste măsuri sau nu? Pentru a formula un răspuns, trebuie mai întâi să înțelegem virusul și modul în care se răspândește, și apoi să analizăm dezbaterea din perspectiva politică, etică, socială și economică. Primul caz raportat de SARS-CoV-2, care cauzează boala COVID-19, a fost în data de 31 decembrie 2019 (\"boala coronavirus\", 2022), și a declanșat o reacție în lanț de instabilitate politică la nivel mondial. Ce a început ca o epidemie în China a ajuns în câteva luni în aproape toate ţările lumii. În ultimii 20 de ani, multe țări au fost afectate de virusuri legate de Covid-19, cum ar fi SARS. Datorită experienţei anterioare, ei au luat imediat măsurile necesare. De exemplu, China nu a avut mai mult de 110.000 de cazuri de la începutul pandemiei, chiar dacă are o populație de aproape 1,5 miliarde (Worldometer, 2022). Cu toate acestea, o țară mai puțin stabilă din punct de vedere politic, cum ar fi Turcia, a fost mai puțin pregătită și a suferit de 12 milioane de cazuri, chiar dacă are o populație de 85 de milioane. Virusul se răspândește foarte repede datorită mecanismului de transmitere aerian. Dacă cineva se află în apropierea unei persoane infectate, exhalația purtătorului poate transporta virusul și poate fi inhalată de persoane sănătoase. Purtarea unei măști și menținerea distanței ajută la prevenirea răspândirii particulelor de virus în vecinătatea persoanelor sănătoase. Cu toate acestea, în ţările în care măsurile nu au fost aplicate, s-a înregistrat o creştere semnificativă a deceselor excesive. Noua variantă omicron se dovedește a se răspândi de cel puțin 20 de ori mai repede decât tulpina originală din cauza a 30 de mutații (Grossman și Stahel, 2022). Din fericire, este, de asemenea, mult mai puțin letală, deoarece nu atacă țesutul pulmonar în stadiile sale inițiale (Zimmer și Ghorayshi, 2021). Se pot analiza și restricțiile legate de coronavirus dintr-o perspectivă etică: ar trebui să reducem măsurile legate de coronavirus chiar dacă acest lucru ar putea pune în pericol mai multe vieți? Începând cu 28 ianuarie 2021, coronavirusul are o rată a mortalității de 0,51%. Aceasta este o rată relativ ridicată în comparație cu alte virusuri respiratorii, cum ar fi gripa, care are o rată de mortalitate de 0,01%. COVID-19 afectează în mod disproporționat grupurile vulnerabile, cum ar fi cele cu afecțiuni de sănătate subiacente, cum ar fi diabetul zaharat, obezitatea sau bolile autoimune. Acest lucru este valabil mai ales la persoanele în vârstă, din cauza numărului crescut de afecţiuni de sănătate, precum şi a sistemului imunitar deteriorat odată cu vârsta. Coronavirusul infectează tractul respirator superior, inclusiv plămânii. Intră în celule şi le ordonă să creeze copii ale virusului. Apoi, celula se deschide şi trimite noi copii ale virusului către alte celule. În cele din urmă, dacă nu există un răspuns imun eficient, pacientul va pieri din cauza leziunilor pulmonare, în special cu tulpinile de COVID-19 anterioare variantei Omicron. În timpul unei închideri, există un contact uman minim, ceea ce încetinește răspândirea virusului. Totuşi, împiedicarea contactului social are propriile sale efecte devastatoare. De exemplu, în timpul perioadei de blocare, peste 2,5 milioane de copii au fost expuși riscului de a rămâne în urmă în învățare (<unk>Jongeren<unk> 2021') (\"Educația și COVID-19\", 2022). În plus, potrivit OSF Healthcare, \"Vizitele săptămânale medii la departamentul de urgență pentru tentative de sinucidere suspectate în rândul fetelor tinere au crescut cu peste 50% față de aceeași perioadă a anului trecut\" (OSF Health Care, 2021). Astfel, chiar dacă mai multe vieți sunt puse în joc, prin luarea de măsuri suplimentare pentru cei din grupul de risc, se poate redeschide în siguranță societatea și se pot preveni sinuciderile și dificultățile de învățare la tineri. Mai mult, vaccinurile pot preveni apariţia unor daune majore la ţesuturi. Din perspectiva societății, coronavirusul s-a dovedit a fi o \"problemă de divizare\", împingând unii oameni să refuze vaccinul. Mulţi cetăţeni se abţin să se vaccineze fără să înţeleagă cu adevărat consecinţele. Există două tipuri de vaccinuri: ARNm și vector viral. Vaccinul mRNA COVID-19 a fost primul vaccin mRNA care a fost utilizat în rândul publicului larg. Vaccinurile mRNA au ARN în interiorul lipidelor care ajută ARN-ul să intre în celulă. Ribozomii citesc ARN-ul și instruiesc celulele să producă aceleași proteine spike ca SARS-CoV-2. Organismul recunoaște apoi că proteinele spike Corona sunt invadatoare și creează anticorpi pentru a le distruge. În comparație, vaccinurile cu vector viral introduc o copie inofensivă a virusului cu același ADN al proteinei de vârf, determinând sistemul imunitar să îl atace și să-l amintească. Pentru ambele tipuri de vaccinuri, celulele B de memorie vor continua să creeze anticorpi în cazul în care persoana este expusă virusului real în viitor. Potrivit Dr. Stahel, <unk>Omicron a mutat atât de mult încât are mai puțină afinitate în ceea ce privește anticorpii din vaccin care îl recunosc, deci, prin urmare, răspunsul este injecția de rapel, deoarece veți copleși virusul cu cantitatea răspunsului imunitar chiar dacă nu există o potrivire perfectă<unk> (Grossman și Stahel, 2022). Astfel, dozele inițiale de vaccin și, mai recent, doza de rapel joacă un rol important în prevenirea infecțiilor, dar mai important în reducerea riscului de boală severă și de deces. Cu toate acestea, noi studii au arătat că imunitatea efectivă poate dispărea în decurs de şase luni, ceea ce face necesară administrarea de doze anuale, similare cu cele pentru gripă (Doucleff). 13,6% din populația de peste 18 ani refuză să se vaccineze, în principal din cauza neîncrederii în guvern (Vaccinări vaccinări COVID-19, 2022). Acest lucru limitează efectele imunității colective, un concept în care, dacă suficient de mulți oameni sunt vaccinați, virusul nu va mai putea să se răspândească datorită faptului că toate țintele sunt imune. În cele din urmă, trebuie să se ia în considerare implicaţiile economice ale unei închideri. Închiderea a cauzat șomaj colosal, în special pentru cei care lucrau în industria turismului. De exemplu, potrivit Forumului Economic Mondial, 114 milioane de persoane și-au pierdut locurile de muncă în 2020 (Richter, 2021). În plus, închiderile din întreaga lume au cauzat, de asemenea, o pierdere estimată la 3,2 trilioane de euro în veniturile din muncă. Chiar și cu efectele economice devastatoare, trebuie să se ia în considerare faptul că viețile sunt puse în joc atunci când nu se iau măsuri corespunzătoare de coronă. Potrivit NPR, numărul cazurilor ar fi fost de aproximativ 488 de ori mai mare în China dacă s-ar fi luat măsuri insuficiente, salvând astfel milioane de vieți (Beaubien, 2020). În concluzie, luând în considerare COVID-19 dintr-o perspectivă politică, etică, socială și economică, concluzionez că, deși virusul este extrem de contagios și fatal pentru anumite grupuri, închiderile sunt doar soluții temporare. O închidere este benefică pentru societatea noastră doar atunci când mortalitatea excesivă începe să crească. Prin urmare, luând măsuri timpurii, ţările pot limita răspândirea virusului. De exemplu, au trecut șase luni până când purtarea mascii a fost considerată o măsură viabilă. După cum s-a văzut în prima perioadă de blocare, zeci de mii de persoane și-au pierdut locurile de muncă, iar peste 2,5 milioane de copii au trebuit să urmeze cursuri de învățare la distanță în Olanda (\"Jongeren\", 2021). Astfel, luând măsuri la timp și fiind pregătit, nu este nevoie să intrați în izolare. Cu toate acestea, dacă decesele încep să devină excesive, merită să se impună o cantitate proporțională de măsuri legate de corona.", "output": " ailment."}

Planul ei a fost să-şi petreacă după-amiaza în parc ca s-o lase pe Stella să alerge şi să se caţere, ca s-o epuizeze puţin. Din nefericire, această excursie a fost zădărnicită de ploaia constantă, aşa că Lisa s-a resemnat cu o zi înăuntru cu micul tiran. Stella a sosit devreme şi era încântată să joace. Lisa a decis să înceapă cu un joc de-a v-aţi ascunselea, după toate acestea ar putea ocupa o bună parte a dimineţii fără prea multe probleme. Stella a fugit să se ascundă şi Lisa a stat liniştită să bea cafea în timp ce o striga pe fetiţă, prefăcându-se că o caută. În cele din urmă, ea a pornit să găsească fetița, dar în curând a realizat că ceva nu era în regulă. Oriunde s-ar fi uitat, Stella nu era nicăieri. Casa nu a fost atât de mare, ceea ce face dispariția ei chiar mai confuz. Lisa s-a mutat recent în casa pe care a cumpărat-o de la mătuşa ei, cu puţin timp înainte de moartea ei şi nici măcar nu a mutat toată mobila existentă. Poate că Stella s-a blocat undeva în spatele dulapului mare din dormitor sau s-a urcat într-un dulap din spălătorie. Panica a început să se instaleze în timp ce ea a mutat dulapul mai departe de perete, în cazul în care numai un copil mic ar fi putut ascunde înainte. Deodată, a văzut o mică crăpătură în perete, şi apoi a realizat că era o uşă mică despre care nu ştia că era acolo. Uşa era uşor deschisă şi în cele din urmă a mutat dulapul suficient pentru a deschide uşa şi a urcat înăuntru. Ce era locul ăsta? Intrarea s-a deschis şi a dezvăluit o cameră mică despre care Lisa nu ştia că există! Era plină de comori, lingouri de aur şi bijuterii. Stella stătea în mijlocul camerei şi se juca liniştită cu comoara, fără să-şi dea seama de imensa valoare cu care era înconjurată. Lisa ştia că mătuşa ei era o femeie secretă, dar aceasta a fost o descoperire incredibilă şi i-a schimbat viaţa pentru totdeauna. Vizita Stellei a fost talismanul norocului de care avea nevoie pentru a deschide această recompensă şi i-ar fi recunoscătoare pentru totdeauna fetiţei!

Banii merg la echipament şi boabe de cacao. Pentru echipament, veţi avea nevoie de o mașină de măcinat boabele (aproximativ 600 de dolari) şi de o mașină de temperat (aproximativ 400 de dolari) pentru a obţine produsul finit. De asemenea, veţi avea nevoie de o saltea de silicon (aproximativ 20 de dolari) şi de un uscător de păr (aproximativ 30 de dolari). Dar să începem de la început.  Cumpăraţi între două şi şase kilograme de boabe de cacao crude fermentate. Există o varietate de importatori cu amănuntul pe care îi puteți găsi pe internet. Alegeţi o singură varietate sau un amestec de ciocolată care să vă placă.  Sortează fasolea, îndepărtând fasolea ruptă, fasolea foarte deformată şi orice corp străin ar putea fi prezent.  Se prăjesc boabele, câte un kilogram la un moment dat, la temperatura de 350 F, timp de 20 până la 30 de minute, în funcţie de experienţa ta cu boabele sau de mirosul lor. Vor mirosi ca prăjiturile proaspete. Nu le arde!  Lasă fasolea să se răcească.  Curăţă fasolea. Puteţi face asta manual - ceea ce eu consider că produce un produs superior - dar fiţi atenţi că acest lucru poate dura până la 6 ore pe kilogram. Alternativ, puteţi cumpăra un uscător de vin şi să folosiţi uscătorul de păr pentru a sufla pieile. Această abordare este mult mai rapidă, dar lasă mai multă piele şi pierde mai multe fragmente de fasole. Oricum ar fi, cântăreşte producţia finală de fasole.  Să te fac să te mişti. Foloseşte uscătorul de păr ca suprafeţele de măcinat să fie la cel puţin 40 de grade Celsius. Adăugaţi fasolea câte o mână. Ajută-l pe Melanger dacă se blochează. Asigură-te că mixerul merge în mod constant înainte de a-l lăsa nesupravegheat. Când va începe, va curge bine.  Fă-l să funcţioneze timp de 24 până la 72 de ore, din nou în funcţie de experienţa ta cu fasolea şi de gusturile tale. Dacă încercaţi un amestec de fasole, adăugaţi fasolea cu o aromă mai puternică la începutul procesului şi fasolea cu o aromă mai delicată mai târziu. Dă-i cel puţin 8 ore chiar şi celor mai delicate fasole. Adaugă zahăr după gust. Procentul de zahăr în greutate poate varia de la câţiva la sută până la 30 la sută. De asemenea, puteți adăuga lapte uscat integral în acest moment, și alte arome, cum ar fi un inch sau mai mult de fasole de vanilie. Se amestecă zahărul și alți aditivi timp de cel puțin încă 8 ore. Scopul este de a reduce dimensiunea particulelor sub ceea ce poate fi detectat de limbă. Când se termină, se decantează într-o tigaie de coacere din silicon. Aceasta este ciocolata ta neperforată. Se topeşte uşor şi tinde să se sfărâmă pe măsură ce îmbătrâneşte. De aceea va trebui să-l temperăm.  În cele din urmă, urmaţi instrucţiunile de pe aparatul de temperat, adăugând bucăţi de ciocolată netemperată, aşa cum este indicat. Ciocolata lichidă temperată poate fi folosită pentru înmuierea fructelor sau poate fi turnată în forme pentru bare sau bomboane în formă.

Dezbaterea cu privire la faptul dacă natura (natura intrinsecă, atitudinea sau predispoziția) sau creșterea (îngrijirea, învățăturile sau condiționarea) unui copil este mai responsabilă pentru cine sau ce devin în viața adultă.  În mare parte se consideră că oamenii sunt un produs al contextului (Nurture). Situaţiile în care am fost crescuţi au o influenţă considerabilă asupra a ceea ce devenim mai târziu în viaţă.

Există nenumărate exemple de copii care s-au născut în circumstanțe extrem de dificile, care au crescut pentru a fi bine rotunjite, membri cu contribuții înalte ale societății.  Ca rezultat, ar fi rezonabil să presupunem că natura este un factor puternic, indiferent de educația (mediul) în care o persoană este crescută. La urma urmei, nu există nicio garanţie că cineva care creşte într-o familie abuzivă va abuza şi el de alţii. Deci natura e mai importantă?

Nu mai văzuse niciodată o comoară atât de strălucitoare, era culoarea curcubeului, şi când s-a uitat mai atent, părea înfricoşător de asemănătoare cu o scară de dragon, dar nu putea să creadă că era cu adevărat o scară de dragon pentru că existau doar în poveştile pe care le citeşte.

Un alt motiv pentru care vedem mai puţini fluturi este hrana pentru omizi. Cele mai multe fluturi şi molii (sau fluturi ale nopţii, cum îmi place să le spun) au nevoie de o anumită plantă pentru a-şi găzdui omizile. Pentru fluturi monarh, este vorba de un nume nefericit pentru o plantă frumoasă, Asclepias. Pentru Pipevine Swallowtails, este Pipevine (Aristolochia). Fără aceste plante, omizile nu au nici o sursă de hrană. Şi, pe măsură ce oraşele şi suburbiile devin pavate, nu mai există loc pentru aceste plante, cândva abundente, să crească. Când ne uităm în curtea noastră, găsim plante frumoase importate din alte locuri. Dar pentru un fluture, curţile noastre par deşerturi. Chiar şi plantele precum bottlebrush, care atrag o mulţime de insecte pentru nectar, nu oferă hrană pentru puii de insecte. E ca şi cum ai avea un bar unde adulţii pot bea, dar nu ai avea mâncare pentru copiii lor, ca să poată creşte şi ei ca adulţi.  Dar Doug Tallamy, un entomolog de la Universitatea din Delaware, spune că putem ajuta. Dacă punem plante autohtone în curtea noastră, putem oferi hrană pentru a aduce înapoi fluturii.  În timp ce ne pregăteam să ne refacem grădina de la plante ornamentale veșnic verzi, la o grădină engleză cu flori tăiate, s-a întâmplat ceva. L-am văzut pe Doug Tallamy vorbind la o întâlnire CNPS Silicon Valley Zoom. Şi ne-am dat seama că trebuie să ne schimbăm direcţia şi să începem grădinăritul cu băştinaşii.  Când ne uităm la grădina noastră, cheia este că abia începem... Este un experiment mare pentru a vedea ce funcționează unde. Şi deja grădina vorbeşte cu noi. Iarba cu ochi albaştri a sărit pe drumul pavat spre o altă parte a grădinii! Ne așteptăm la mai multă mișcare și magie în viitor. Iată câteva gânduri despre grădina noastră.  Binecuvântări... având un stejar uriaş în curtea noastră şi un pârâu în spatele nostru ne-a dat cu siguranţă un avantaj în ceea ce priveşte accesul la hrană şi la animale sălbatice în curtea noastră.  Partea proastă... multă umbră. Doar două, poate trei locuri în grădina noastră care obține soare bun. Deci, ne plimbăm prin Calscape în căutarea plantelor care vor tolera umbra. (Dacă nu l-aţi întâlnit pe Calscape, vă aşteaptă o plăcere. Sper că locuieşti în California...).  Ca Talamiti, credem în hrănirea ecosistemului, care începe cu creşterea omizilor. Şi cum a mers? Ei bine, am văzut doar una sau două omizi până acum. Suspină. Totul e un experiment...  Cel mai mare impact... lăsând frunzele anul trecut. Putem vedea deja cum solul se îmbunătățește, și de fiecare dată când udăm vedem o mulțime de insecte care se ridică din cădere. Deci se întâmplă. Încet...  Aşa că continuăm să înlocuim non-nativi cu nativi. Săptămâna trecută am eliminat Sarcococca şi Pierris Japonicas şi le-am înlocuit cu Coffeeberry (Frangula Californica). În acest weekend am tăiat doi arţari şi i-am înlocuit cu anemone de pădure (Carpenteria Californica). Iar weekendul viitor vom înlocui gardul cu Coyote Brush (Baccharis pilularis).  În afară de gândaci, am văzut multe alte animale sălbatice în curtea noastră. Un nou cuib de veveriţe se naşte în copac în fiecare an. Şi anul acesta am fost surprinşi de 3 pui de raton care s-au mutat în copac (este în mare parte gol).  Sunt drăguţi, timizi şi adorabili. Ne-am bucurat să-i vedem ieşind şi căutând în copac în fiecare seară mâncare.", "output": " Yes, you can use a blender or food processor to blend up the ingredients and make a smoothie.

Prin combinarea acestor materiale într-un dispozitiv numit tranzistor, suntem capabili să creăm o componentă electronică care va conduce electricitatea doar atunci când un mic curent electric este aplicat la așa-numitul pin de bază al tranzistorului.  O utilizare evidentă a unui astfel de comportament este utilizarea tranzistorului ca întrerupător - prin aplicarea sau eliminarea curentului la pinul de bază putem controla dacă tranzistorul conduce electricitatea prin intermediul pinurilor sale colector și emitor. Atunci când nu este prezent curent la pinul de bază, tranzistorul va bloca transmiterea electrică prin emitorul și colectorul său.  În general, curentul electric necesar pentru a controla tranzistorul de la pinul de bază este foarte mic. Curenții mult mai mari pot fi transferați prin dispozitiv prin pinii colectorului și emițătorului. Astfel, un tranzistor utilizează un curent de intrare foarte mic pentru a controla fluxul unui curent mult mai mare.  Un semnal audio, de exemplu, este transmis ca un curent electric de putere foarte mică - în forma sa originală este prea mic pentru a fi capabil să conducă un difuzor pentru a face sunete care sunt audibile pentru urechea umană. Pentru a amplifica acest semnal astfel încât să fie utilizabil pentru redarea audio, putem aplica semnalul audio la pinul de bază al unui tranzistor - acest lucru va permite un curent mult mai mare să curgă între emitenții și pinii colectorului și prin tranzistor.

Din punct de vedere statistic, un model de preferință este ușor vizibil pe ceea ce oamenii ar descrie ca frumos. Un exemplu evident al acestui fenomen este standardul de frumuseţe pentru femei şi bărbaţi. Societatea pare să fie de acord cu privire la ce trăsături, atât fizice, cât şi interioare, pot considera o persoană frumoasă. Standardul de frumusețe este, de asemenea, proiectat dincolo de oameni, pe rase de animale, de exemplu, în expozițiile de pisici. Se pare că există o legătură între frumuseţe şi cât de mult seamănă ea cu perfecţiunea. De exemplu, un trandafir cu multe petale şi fără lacrimi sau zgârieturi este, în general, considerat mai frumos decât unul cu mai puţine petale, vizibil distruse. Cu toate acestea, întrebarea perfecțiunii ridică și o problemă, deoarece este dificil și, probabil, imposibil de definit perfecțiunea. Frumuseţea nu înseamnă neapărat perfecţiune. De exemplu, ochii mari sunt considerați din punct de vedere statistic mai atractivi, însă, în ceea ce privește scopul lor biologic, nu au superioritate față de ochii mici. Prin urmare, atât frumuseţea, cât şi perfecţiunea depind de perspectiva sau de scopul cu care priveşti un obiect.  În plus, trebuie luate în considerare şi fluctuaţiile evidente care au avut loc de-a lungul secolelor şi culturilor în ceea ce priveşte ceea ce este considerat frumos. De exemplu, tendinţele modei şi stilurile de artă se schimbă constant. În plus, diversitatea de opinii sugerează că nu există nimic care să fie considerat frumos de toată lumea, deci chiar dacă majoritatea consideră un anumit obiect sau lucru frumos, frumusețea lui rămâne subiectivă, deoarece rămâne bazată pe o preferință în continuă schimbare, mai degrabă decât pe un adevăr obiectiv.", "output": " Subjectivist or objective?

(/ˈtɛslə/ TESS-lə sau /ˈtɛzlə/ TEZ-lə[a]) este o companie americană multinațională de automobile și energie curată cu sediul în Austin, Texas, Statele Unite. Tesla proiectează și fabrică vehicule electrice (mașini și camioane electrice), stocare de energie în baterii de la domiciliu la scară de rețea, panouri solare și țigle solare pentru acoperișuri, precum și produse și servicii conexe. Tesla este una dintre cele mai valoroase companii din lume și este, începând cu 2023, cel mai valoros producător de automobile din lume. În 2021, compania a avut cele mai mari vânzări la nivel mondial de vehicule electrice cu baterii și vehicule electrice plug-in, capturând 21% din piața de vehicule electrice cu baterii (pur electrice) și 14% din piața plug-in (care include vehicule hibride plug-in). Prin intermediul filialei sale Tesla Energy, compania dezvoltă și este un important instalator de sisteme fotovoltaice în Statele Unite. Tesla Energy este, de asemenea, unul dintre cei mai mari furnizori globali de sisteme de stocare a energiei prin baterii, cu 3,99 gigawatt-oră (GWh) instalate în 2021.  Tesla a fost încorporată în iulie 2003 de Martin Eberhard și Marc Tarpenning ca Tesla Motors. Numele companiei este un omagiu adus inventatorului și inginerului electric Nikola Tesla. În februarie 2004, printr-o investiție de 6,5 milioane de dolari, Elon Musk a devenit cel mai mare acționar al companiei. El a fost CEO din 2008. Potrivit lui Musk, scopul Tesla este de a ajuta la accelerarea trecerii la transport și energie durabilă, obținute prin vehicule electrice și energie solară. Tesla a început producția primului său model de mașină, mașina sport Roadster, în 2008. Acesta a fost urmat de sedanul Model S în 2012, SUV-ul Model X în 2015, sedanul Model 3 în 2017, crossoverul Model Y în 2020 și camionul Tesla Semi în 2022. Compania intenționează să înceapă producția camionetei ușoare Cybertruck în 2023. Model 3 este cea mai bine vândută mașină electrică plug-in din lume și, în iunie 2021, a devenit prima mașină electrică care a vândut 1 milion de unități la nivel global. Livrările Tesla pentru întregul an 2022 au fost de aproximativ 1,31 milioane de vehicule, o creștere de 40% față de anul precedent, iar vânzările cumulate au totalizat 3 milioane de mașini în august 2022. În octombrie 2021, capitalizarea de piață a Tesla a ajuns la 1 trilion de dolari, a șasea companie care a făcut acest lucru în istoria SUA.

Povestea începe pe Trantor, capitala Imperiului Galactic vechi de 12.000 de ani, puternic, dar încet-încet în descompunere. Hari Seldon, matematician și psiholog, a dezvoltat psiho-istoria, un nou domeniu al științei și psihologiei care tratează toate posibilitățile în societățile mari prin matematică, permițând predicția probabilistă a evenimentelor viitoare.  Prin intermediul psiho-istoriei, Seldon a descoperit declinul și eventual căderea Imperiului, supărând membrii aristocrați ai Comisiei de Securitate Publică, conducătorii de facto ai Imperiului. Comisia consideră că opiniile și declarațiile lui Seldon sunt trădătoare, iar el este arestat împreună cu tânărul matematician Gaal Dornick, care a sosit pe Trantor pentru a se alătura grupului lui Seldon. Seldon este judecat de către Comisie; el își apără credințele, explicând teoriile și previziunile sale, inclusiv credința sa că Imperiul se va prăbuși în 300 de ani și în timp ce un al doilea imperiu se va ridica în cele din urmă, acesta va veni numai după o epocă întunecată de 30.000 de ani. El informează Comisia că o alternativă la acest viitor este realizabilă și le explică că crearea unui compendiu al tuturor cunoștințelor umane, Enciclopedia Galactica, nu poate preveni căderea inevitabilă a Imperiului, dar ar reduce epoca întunecată la un mileniu.  Comisia sceptică, care nu vrea să-l facă pe Seldon un martir, îi oferă exilul într-o lume îndepărtată, Terminus, împreună cu alții care l-ar putea ajuta să creeze Enciclopedia. El acceptă oferta lor, se pregătește pentru plecarea \"Enciclopedistilor\" și primește un decret imperial care îi recunoaște oficial acțiunile. Seldon îl informează pe Dornick că, în ciuda credinței Imperiului că a câștigat prin exilul lui Seldon, rezultatul a fost exact ceea ce intenționa și spera. Terminus va fi casa primei Fundaţii, în timp ce o a doua va fi stabilită la \"Star's End\".

Numită după cancelarul Otto von Bismarck, nava a fost pusă la bază la șantierul naval Blohm & Voss din Hamburg în iulie 1936 și lansată în februarie 1939. Lucrările au fost finalizate în august 1940, când a fost încorporat în flota germană. Bismarck și nava-soră Tirpitz au fost cele mai mari corabii construite vreodată de Germania și două dintre cele mai mari construite de orice putere europeană.  În cursul carierei de opt luni a navei de război, Bismarck a efectuat doar o singură operațiune ofensivă care a durat 8 zile în mai 1941, cu numele de cod Rheinübung. Nava, împreună cu crucișătorul greu Prinz Eugen, urma să pătrundă în Oceanul Atlantic și să atace transportul maritim aliat din America de Nord până în Marea Britanie. Cele două nave au fost detectate de mai multe ori în largul Scandinaviei, iar unitățile navale britanice au fost desfășurate pentru a le bloca ruta. În bătălia din Strâmtoarea Danemarcei, crucișătorul de luptă HMS Hood a atacat inițial Prinz Eugen, probabil din greșeală, în timp ce HMS Prince of Wales a atacat Bismarck. În bătălia care a urmat, Hood a fost distrusă de focul combinat al Bismarckului și Prinz Eugen, care a deteriorat apoi Prince of Wales și a forțat retragerea sa. Bismarck a suferit suficiente daune din cauza a trei lovituri de la Prince of Wales pentru a pune capăt misiunii de atac.  Distrugerea lui Hood a provocat o urmărire neobosită de către Marina Regală, implicând zeci de nave de război. Două zile mai târziu, îndreptându-se spre Franța ocupată pentru a efectua reparații, Bismarck a fost atacat de cincisprezece bombardiere cu torpile Fairey Swordfish de pe portavionul HMS Ark Royal; unul a înregistrat o lovitură care a făcut ca uneltele de direcție ale cuirassatului să nu mai funcționeze. În ultima ei bătălie a doua zi dimineață, Bismarck, deja paralizat, a fost atacat de două cuirase britanice și de două crucișătoare grele, și a suferit daune incapacitante și pierderi mari de vieți. Nava a fost scufundată pentru a împiedica îmbarcarea britanicilor și pentru a permite abandonarea navei pentru a limita pierderile ulterioare. Majoritatea experţilor sunt de acord că avariile din bătălie ar fi cauzat scufundarea ei în cele din urmă.

{"model_name": "wenge-research/yayi-7b", "input": "Pe baza pasajului următor, descrieți primul dispozitiv solid-state și utilizarea acestuia.\nContext:Cu mult înainte de a exista cunoştinţe despre electricitate, oamenii erau conştienţi de şocurile de la peştii electrici. Textele egiptene antice datând din 2750 î.Hr. se referea la acești pești ca la \"Tunetul Nilului\" și i-a descris ca fiind \"protectorii\" tuturor celorlalți pești. Peștii electrici au fost din nou raportați milenii mai târziu de către naturalistii și medicii greci, romani și arabi din antichitate. Mai mulți scriitori antici, precum Pliniu cel Bătrân și Scribonius Largus, au atestat efectul amorțitor al șocurilor electrice emise de catfish-ul electric și de razele electrice și știau că astfel de șocuri puteau călători de-a lungul obiectelor conductoare. Pacienţii cu boli cum ar fi guta sau durerile de cap au fost îndrumaţi să atingă peşti electrici în speranţa că şocul puternic i-ar putea vindeca. Culturile antice din jurul Mediteranei știau că anumite obiecte, cum ar fi tije de chihlimbar, puteau fi frecate cu blană de pisică pentru a atrage obiecte ușoare, cum ar fi penele. Thales din Miletus a făcut o serie de observații asupra electricității statice în jurul anului 600 î.Hr., din care a crezut că frecarea a făcut ca chihlimbarul să fie magnetic, spre deosebire de minerale precum magnetitul, care nu aveau nevoie de frecare. Thales a greşit când a crezut că atracţia se datorează unui efect magnetic, dar mai târziu ştiinţa va dovedi o legătură între magnetism şi electricitate. Potrivit unei teorii controversate, parții ar fi putut avea cunoștințe despre galvanoplastie, pe baza descoperirii din 1936 a bateriei din Bagdad, care seamănă cu o celulă galvanică, deși nu este sigur dacă artefactul a fost de natură electrică. Electricitatea va rămâne puțin mai mult decât o curiozitate intelectuală timp de milenii, până în 1600, când savantul englez William Gilbert a scris De Magnete, în care a făcut un studiu atent al electricității și magnetismului, deosebind efectul lodestone de electricitatea statică produsă prin frecarea chihlimbarului. El a inventat cuvântul latin electricus (\"de chihlimbar\" sau \"ca chihlimbarul\", elektron, cuvântul grecesc pentru \"chihlimbar\") pentru a se referi la proprietatea de a atrage obiecte mici după ce au fost frecate. Această asociere a dat naștere cuvintelor englezești \"electric\" și \"electricitate\", care au apărut pentru prima dată în imprimare în Pseudodoxia Epidemica a lui Thomas Browne din 1646. Lucrări suplimentare au fost efectuate în secolele al XVII-lea și începutul secolului al XVIII-lea de către Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray și C. F. du Fay. Mai târziu, în secolul al XVIII-lea, Benjamin Franklin a efectuat cercetări ample în domeniul electricităţii, vânzându-şi bunurile pentru a-şi finanţa munca. În iunie 1752, se spune că el a atașat o cheie de metal la partea de jos a unei corzi umede de zmeu și a zburat zmeul pe un cer amenințat de furtună. O succesiune de scântei sărit de la cheie la spatele mâinii sale a arătat că fulgerul a fost într-adevăr de natură electrică. El a explicat, de asemenea, comportamentul aparent paradoxal al borcanului Leyden ca un dispozitiv pentru stocarea unor cantități mari de sarcină electrică în termeni de electricitate constând atât din sarcini pozitive, cât și negative. În 1775, Hugh Williamson a raportat Societății Regale o serie de experimente privind șocurile eliberate de anghila electrică; în același an, chirurgul și anatomul John Hunter a descris structura organelor electrice ale peștelui. În 1791, Luigi Galvani şi-a publicat descoperirea bioelectromagnetismului, demonstrând că electricitatea era mijlocul prin care neuronii transmiteau semnale către muşchi. Bateria, sau pila voltaică, a lui Alessandro Volta din 1800, fabricată din straturi de zinc şi cupru, a oferit o sursă de energie electrică mai sigură pentru oamenii de ştiinţă decât mașinile electrostatice folosite anterior. Recunoașterea electromagnetismului, unitatea fenomenelor electrice și magnetice, se datorează lui Hans Christian Ørsted și André-Marie Ampère în 1819-1820. Michael Faraday a inventat motorul electric în 1821, iar Georg Ohm a analizat matematic circuitul electric în 1827. Electricitatea și magnetismul (și lumina) au fost legate definitiv de James Clerk Maxwell, în special în lucrarea sa \"Despre liniile fizice ale forței\" în 1861 și 1862. În timp ce la începutul secolului al XIX-lea s-au înregistrat progrese rapide în știința electrică, la sfârșitul secolului al XIX-lea s-au înregistrat cele mai mari progrese în ingineria electrică. Prin oameni precum Alexander Graham Bell, Ottó Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, primul baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla și George Westinghouse, electricitatea s-a transformat dintr-o curiozitate științifică într-un instrument esențial pentru viața modernă. În 1887, Heinrich Hertz a descoperit că electrozii iluminați cu lumină ultravioletă creează mai ușor scântei electrice. În 1905, Albert Einstein a publicat o lucrare care a explicat datele experimentale din efectul fotoelectric ca fiind rezultatul energiei luminii care este transportată în pachete cuantice discrete, energizând electronii. Această descoperire a dus la revoluţia cuantică. Einstein a primit Premiul Nobel pentru Fizică în 1921 pentru \"descoperirea legii efectului fotoelectric\". Efectul fotoelectric este, de asemenea, utilizat în fotocelule, cum ar fi cele care se găsesc în panourile solare. Primul dispozitiv solid-state a fost \"detectorul de mustață de pisică\" folosit pentru prima dată în anii 1900 în receptoarele radio. Un fir în formă de mustață este pus ușor în contact cu un cristal solid (cum ar fi un cristal de germaniu) pentru a detecta un semnal radio prin efectul de joncțiune de contact. Într-o componentă solidă, curentul este limitat la elemente solide și compuși concepuți special pentru a-l comuta și amplifica. Fluxul de curent poate fi înțeles în două forme: ca electroni încărcați negativ și ca deficiențe de electroni încărcați pozitiv numite găuri. Aceste sarcini şi găuri sunt înţelese în termenii fizicii cuantice. Materialul de construcție este cel mai adesea un semiconductor cristalin. Electronica în stare solidă a apărut odată cu apariția tehnologiei tranzistorilor. Primul tranzistor funcțional, un tranzistor cu contact punctal bazat pe germaniu, a fost inventat de John Bardeen și Walter Houser Brattain la Laboratoarele Bell în 1947, urmat de tranzistorul cu joncțiune bipolară în 1948.", "target": "Primul dispozitiv solid-state a fost \"detectorul de mustață de pisică\" folosit pentru prima dată în anii 1900 în receptoarele radio.

În mod tradițional, triatlonul este un sport individual și fiecare atlet concurează împotriva cursului și a ceasului pentru cel mai bun timp. Ca atare, sportivii nu au voie să primească asistență de la altcineva în afara cursei, cu excepția voluntarilor de ajutor sancționați de cursă care distribuie mâncare și apă pe curs.   Zona de tranziție (biciclete) la Triatlonul din Hamburg, 2002 Triatloanele sunt cronometrate în cinci secțiuni secvențiale:  de la începutul înotului până la începutul primei tranziții (timp de înot); de la începutul primei tranziții până la sfârșitul primei tranziții (timpul T1); de la începutul ciclismului până la sfârșitul etapei ciclistice (timpul ciclului); de la începutul celei de a doua tranziții până la sfârșitul celei de a doua tranziții (timpul T2); în final, de la începutul cursei până la sfârșitul ei, moment în care triatlonul este finalizat. Rezultatele sunt de obicei afișate pe site-urile oficiale și vor arăta pentru fiecare triatlonist timpul său de înot; timpul ciclului (cu tranziții incluse); timpul de alergare; și timpul total. Unele rase de asemenea post timp de tranziție separat.  Alte reguli ale triatlonului variază de la o cursă la alta și, în general, implică descrieri ale echipamentului permis (de exemplu, sunt permise costume de înot în evenimentele USAT în etapa de înot a unor curse atunci când temperatura apei este sub 25,6 ° C (78,1 ° F)), și interdicții împotriva interferenței între sportivi. În plus, utilizarea de aripioare sau alte instrumente de propulsie și de plutire este ilegală în triatlon și poate duce la descalificare.  O regulă care implică piciorul de ciclism este că casca concurentului trebuie să fie pusă înainte ca concurentul să se urce (sau chiar să ia posesia, în anumite jurisdicții) pe bicicletă și trebuie să rămână până când concurentul a coborât; concurentul nu poate fi obligat să poarte casca atunci când nu este pe bicicletă (de exemplu, în timp ce repară o problemă mecanică). Nerespectarea acestei reguli va duce la descalificare. În plus, pe parcursul cursei de biciclete, toate bicicletele trebuie să fie propulsate numai prin forță umană și putere umană. Cu excepția împingerii unei biciclete, orice acțiune de propulsie provocată de utilizarea mâinilor este interzisă. În cazul în care motocicleta unui concurent are o defecțiune, acesta poate continua cursa atâta timp cât face acest lucru cu bicicleta la remorcare. Există, de asemenea, reguli stricte cu privire la linia de \"montare a bicicletei\". Concurenții nu pot începe să meargă pe bicicletă în afara tranziției până când nu depășesc o linie clar marcată. A fi montat pe bicicletă înainte de aceasta poate duce la o penalizare (exemplu: o penalizare de 15 secunde la Jocurile Olimpice de la Londra 2012 a fost impusă lui Jonathan Brownlee, un concurent din Marea Britanie, pentru că a montat bicicleta prea devreme).

{"model_name": "wenge-research/yayi-7b", "input": "Extrage numele celor care au influențat poezia lui Ruben Dario\nContext:Poezia franceză a avut o influență determinantă în formarea lui Darío ca poet. În primul rând, romanticii, în special Victor Hugo. Mai târziu, Darío a fost influențat în mod decisiv de parnassieni: Théophile Gautier, Catulle Mendès și José María de Heredia. O altă influenţă decisivă a fost scriitorul de proză şi poezie şi eroul naţional al Cubei, Jose Martí. Ultimul element definitoriu al esteticii Darianiene este admirația sa față de simbolisti, în special Paul Verlaine. Recapitulând propria sa traiectorie poetică în poemul inițial al Cantos de vida y esperanza (1905), Darío însuși a sintetizat principalele sale influențe atunci când afirmă că a fost \"puternic cu Hugo și ambiguu cu Verlaine\" (\"con Hugo fuerte y con Verlaine ambiguo\").  În secțiunea \"Palabras Liminares\" din Prosas Profanas (1896) el a scris deja un paragraf care dezvăluie importanța culturii franceze în dezvoltarea lucrării sale literare:  Bătrânul spaniol cu barbă albă arată spre o serie de portrete ilustre: \"Acesta - spune el - este marele Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, un geniu cu o singură mână; acesta este Lope de Vega, acesta este Garcilaso, acesta este Quintana\". Îi cer pentru nobilul Gracián, pentru Tereza de Avila, pentru curajosul Góngora şi cel mai puternic dintre toţi, Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas. Apoi spun: \"Shakespeare! Dante, te rog! Hugo...! (şi în capul meu: Verlaine...!) \" Apoi, când îţi iei rămas bun: \"Bătrâne, e important să spui: soţia mea e din ţara mea; amanta mea e din Paris\".  Los raros este un volum ilustrativ cu privire la gusturile literare, pe care l-a publicat în același an cu Prosas profanas, și dedicat pentru a glisa pe scurt unii dintre scriitorii și intelectualii față de care a simțit o profundă admirație. Printre aceia din carte îi găsim pe Edgar Allan Poe, Villiers de l'Isle Adam, Léon Bloy, Paul Verlaine, Lautréamont, Eugénio de Castro și José Martí (cel din urmă fiind singurul menționat care și-a scris opera literară în limba spaniolă). Predominanţa culturii franceze este mai mult decât evidentă. Darío a scris: \"Modernismul nu este nimic altceva decât poezie şi proză spaniolă care a trecut prin situl fin al poeziei şi prozei franceze bune\". Lăsând deoparte etapa sa inițială, înainte de Azul..., în care poezia sa datorează foarte mult marilor nume ale poeziei spaniole din secolul al XIX-lea, cum ar fi Núñez de Arce și Campoamor, Darío a fost un mare admirator al lui Bécquer. Temele spaniole sunt bine reprezentate în opera sa, deja în Prosas profanas și, în special, după a doua sa călătorie în Spania, în 1899. Conștient de decadența contemporană spaniolă în politică și artă (o preocupare pe care a împărtășit-o cu așa-numita generație a anului 98), el a fost adesea inspirat de personaje și elemente din trecut. În ceea ce privește autorii în alte limbi, merită menționat că a simțit o profundă admirație față de trei scriitori din Statele Unite: Ralph Waldo Emerson, Edgar Allan Poe și Walt Whitman.

Este printre cele mai lungi arcuri naturale de rocă din lume. Arcul este unul dintre multele din zona Devils Garden din nordul parcului. Landscape Arch a fost numit de Frank Beckwith, care a explorat zona în iarna anului 1933-1934 ca lider al unei expediții științifice Arches National Monument. Arcul poate fi atins de o cale de pietriș gradată de 1,3 km.

Ideea că plantele de casă au un efect apreciabil asupra calității aerului din interior se bazează în mare parte pe Studiul Aerului Curat realizat de NASA în anii 1980. Studiul a testat plante în camere sigilate și cu niveluri foarte ridicate de compuși organici volatili (în special benzen, tricloroetilenă și formaldehidă). Acesta a concluzionat că, în măsura în care plantele de cameră îmbunătățesc calitatea aerului, mecanismul de acțiune este cel al microorganismelor din solul de încorporare, mai degrabă decât cel al plantelor în sine.  Plantele de interior au un efect semnificativ din punct de vedere statistic asupra concentrațiilor de monoxid de carbon și dioxid de carbon în mediile interioare normale, reducând nivelurile de dioxid de carbon cu 10-25% și nivelurile de monoxid de carbon cu până la 90%.

În martie 1948, această alianță a fost extinsă prin Tratatul de la Bruxelles pentru a include țările Benelux, formând Organizația Tratatului de la Bruxelles, cunoscută sub numele de Uniunea Occidentală. Discuțiile pentru o alianță militară mai largă, care ar putea include America de Nord, au început, de asemenea, în acea lună în Statele Unite, unde politica lor externă sub Doctrina Truman a promovat solidaritatea internațională împotriva acțiunilor pe care le-au văzut ca agresiune comunistă, cum ar fi lovitura de stat din februarie 1948 în Cehoslovacia. Aceste discuții au dus la semnarea Tratatului Atlanticului de Nord la 4 aprilie 1949 de către statele membre ale Uniunii Occidentale plus Statele Unite, Canada, Portugalia, Italia, Norvegia, Danemarca și Islanda. Diplomatul canadian Lester B. Pearson a fost un autor cheie și redactor al tratatului.  O sală lungă rectangulară cu mai multe rânduri de persoane aşezate pe fiecare parte, şi steaguri agăţate la celălalt capăt. Germania de Vest s-a alăturat NATO în 1955, ceea ce a condus la formarea Pactului de la Varșovia în timpul Războiului Rece. Tratatul Nord-Atlantic a fost în mare parte inactiv până când Războiul Coreean a inițiat înființarea NATO pentru a-l pune în aplicare cu o structură militară integrată. Aceasta a inclus formarea Sediului Suprem al Forțelor Aliate din Europa (SHAPE) în 1951, care a adoptat multe dintre structurile și planurile militare ale Uniunii Occidentale, inclusiv acordurile lor privind standardizarea echipamentului și acordurile privind staționarea forțelor militare străine în țările europene. În 1952, postul de secretar general al NATO a fost stabilit ca principalul civil al organizației. În același an au avut loc și primele mari exerciții maritime ale NATO, Exercise Mainbrace și aderarea Greciei și Turciei la organizație. În urma Conferințelor de la Londra și Paris, Germaniei de Vest i s-a permis să se rearmeze militar, deoarece s-a alăturat NATO în mai 1955, ceea ce a fost, la rândul său, un factor major în crearea Pactului de la Varșovia, dominat de sovietici, care a delimitat cele două părți opuse ale Războiului Rece.  Construcţia Zidului Berlinului în 1961 a marcat un apogeu al tensiunilor din Războiul Rece, când 400.000 de soldaţi americani au fost staţionaţi în Europa. Îndoielile cu privire la puterea relaţiilor dintre statele europene şi Statele Unite au scăzut şi au crescut, împreună cu îndoielile cu privire la credibilitatea apărării NATO împotriva unei potenţiale invazii sovietice - îndoieli care au condus la dezvoltarea unei forţe nucleare franceze independente şi la retragerea Franţei din structura militară a NATO în 1966. În 1982, noua democraţie spaniolă s-a alăturat alianţei.  Revoluțiile din 1989 din Europa au condus la o reevaluare strategică a scopului, naturii, sarcinilor și concentrării NATO pe continent. În octombrie 1990, Germania de Est a devenit parte a Republicii Federale Germania și a alianței, iar în noiembrie 1990, alianța a semnat Tratatul privind forțele armate convenționale din Europa (CFE) la Paris cu Uniunea Sovietică. Acesta a mandatat reduceri militare specifice pe întreg continentul, care au continuat după prăbușirea Pactului de la Varșovia în februarie 1991 și dizolvarea Uniunii Sovietice în decembrie, care a eliminat de facto principalii adversari ai NATO. Acest lucru a început o reducere a cheltuielilor militare și a echipamentelor în Europa. Tratatul CFE a permis semnatarilor să elimine 52.000 de piese de armament convențional în următorii șaisprezece ani și a permis reducerea cheltuielilor militare ale membrilor europeni ai NATO cu 28% din 1990 până în 2015. În 1990, mai mulți lideri occidentali i-au dat asigurări lui Mihail Gorbaciov că NATO nu se va extinde mai departe spre est, după cum au dezvăluit memorandumurile conversațiilor private. Cu toate acestea, textul final al Tratatului privind soluționarea finală cu privire la Germania, semnat mai târziu în același an, nu conținea nicio mențiune privind problema extinderii spre est.  Două secțiuni înalte de beton dintr-un zid într-o gazonă de iarbă în fața unei clădiri curbe cu ferestre de sticlă albastră. Căderea Zidului Berlinului în 1989 a marcat un punct de cotitură în rolul NATO în Europa, iar această secțiune a zidului este acum afișată în afara sediului NATO. În anii 1990, organizația și-a extins activitățile în situații politice și umanitare care nu au fost anterior preocupări ale NATO. În timpul destrămării Iugoslaviei, organizația a efectuat primele sale intervenții militare în Bosnia din 1992 până în 1995 și mai târziu în Iugoslavia în 1999. Aceste conflicte au motivat o restructurare militară majoră după Războiul Rece. Structura militară a NATO a fost redusă și reorganizată, cu noi forțe, cum ar fi sediul Comandamentului Aliat al Corpului de Reacție Rapidă din Europa.  Din punct de vedere politic, organizația a căutat să îmbunătățească relațiile cu noile state autonome din Europa Centrală și de Est, iar în perioada de după Războiul Rece au fost înființate forumuri diplomatice pentru cooperare regională între NATO și vecinii săi, inclusiv inițiativa Parteneriat pentru Pace și Dialogul Mediteranean în 1994, Consiliul de Parteneriat Euro-Atlantic în 1997 și Consiliul mixt permanent NATO-Rusia în 1998. La summitul de la Washington din 1999, Ungaria, Polonia și Republica Cehă s-au alăturat oficial NATO, iar organizația a emis, de asemenea, noi orientări pentru aderare cu \"planuri de acțiune pentru aderare\" individualizate. Aceste planuri au guvernat adăugarea ulterioară a noilor membri ai alianței. Alegerea președintelui francez Nicolas Sarkozy în 2007 a dus la o reformă majoră a poziției militare a Franței, culminând cu revenirea la calitatea de membru cu drepturi depline la 4 aprilie 2009, care a inclus, de asemenea, reintegrarea Franței în structura de comandă militară a NATO, menținând în același timp o descurajare nucleară independentă.  Articolul 5 din Tratatul Nord-Atlantic, care cere statelor membre să vină în ajutorul oricărui stat membru supus unui atac armat, a fost invocat pentru prima și singura dată după atacurile din 11 septembrie, după care trupele au fost desfășurate în Afganistan sub ISAF condus de NATO. Organizația a avut o serie de roluri suplimentare de atunci, inclusiv trimiterea de antrenori în Irak, asistarea în operațiunile de combatere a pirateriei și, în 2011, aplicarea unei zone de interdicție aeriană deasupra Libiei în conformitate cu Rezoluția 1973 a Consiliului de Securitate al ONU.  Anexarea Crimeei de către Rusia a condus la o condamnare puternică de către toți membrii NATO și a fost una dintre cele șapte ori în care Articolul 4, care solicită consultări între membrii NATO, a fost invocat. Timpuri anterioare, inclusiv în timpul războiului din Irak și al războiului civil din Siria. La summitul din 2014 din Țara Galilor, liderii statelor membre ale NATO s-au angajat oficial pentru prima dată să cheltuiască echivalentul a cel puțin 2% din produsul lor intern brut pe apărare până în 2024, ceea ce anterior a fost doar o orientare informală. La summitul de la Varșovia din 2016, țările NATO au convenit asupra creării Prezenței avansate îmbunătățite a NATO, care a desfășurat patru grupuri de luptă multinaționale de dimensiuni de batalioane în Estonia, Letonia, Lituania și Polonia. Înainte și în timpul invaziei rusești din Ucraina din 2022, mai multe țări NATO au trimis trupe terestre, nave de război și avioane de vânătoare pentru a întări flancul estic al alianței, iar mai multe țări au invocat din nou articolul 4. În martie 2022, liderii NATO s-au întâlnit la Bruxelles pentru un summit extraordinar la care au participat și liderii Grupului celor Șapte și ai Uniunii Europene. Statele membre NATO au convenit să înființeze patru grupuri de luptă suplimentare în Bulgaria, Ungaria, România și Slovacia, iar elemente ale Forței de răspuns NATO au fost activate pentru prima dată în istoria NATO.  În iunie 2022, NATO a desfășurat 40.000 de soldați de-a lungul flancului său estic de 2.500 de kilometri pentru a descuraja agresiunea rusă. Mai mult de jumătate din acest număr au fost desfăşuraţi în Bulgaria, România, Ungaria, Slovacia şi Polonia, care cinci ţări mobilizează o forţă considerabilă combinate fost NATO de 259.000 de soldaţi. Pentru a completa Forțele Aeriene ale Bulgariei, Spania a trimis Eurofighter Typhoons, Olanda a trimis opt avioane de atac F-35, iar avioane de atac suplimentare franceze și americane vor ajunge în curând.

Petrificarea este rezultatul înlocuirii unui copac sau a unor plante asemănătoare cu un copac cu piatră printr-un proces de mineralizare care include adesea permineralizarea și înlocuirea. Materialele organice care alcătuiesc pereții celulelor au fost replicate cu minerale (în principal siliciu sub formă de opal, calcedon sau cuarț). În unele cazuri, structura iniţială a ţesutului trunchiului poate fi parţial păstrată. Spre deosebire de alte fosile de plante, care sunt de obicei impresii sau compresii, lemnul petrificat este o reprezentare tridimensională a materialului organic original.  Procesul de petrificare are loc sub pământ, când lemnul devine îngropat în apă sau cenușă vulcanică. Prezența apei reduce disponibilitatea oxigenului, care inhibă descompunerea aerobică a bacteriilor și ciupercilor. Apa încărcată cu minerale care curge prin sedimente poate duce la permineralizare, care apare atunci când mineralele precipită din soluție, umplând interiorul celulelor și alte spații goale. În timpul înlocuirii, pereţii celulelor plantei acţionează ca un şablon pentru mineralizare. Trebuie să existe un echilibru între dezintegrarea celulozei, lignină şi minerale pentru ca detaliile celulare să fie păstrate cu fidelitate. Cea mai mare parte a materiei organice se descompune adesea, cu toate acestea, o parte din lignină poate rămâne. Siliciul sub formă de opal-A, poate încrusta și penetra lemnul relativ rapid în mediile cu izvoare calde.

Relaxarea cantitativă este o formă nouă de politică monetară care a intrat în aplicare pe scară largă după criza financiară din 2007-2008. Aceasta are scopul de a atenua o recesiune economică atunci când inflația este foarte scăzută sau negativă, ceea ce face ca politica monetară standard să fie ineficientă. Strângerea cantitativă (QT) are efectul opus, în cazul în care, din motive de politică monetară, o bancă centrală vinde o parte din deținerile sale de obligațiuni de stat sau alte active financiare.  În mod similar cu operațiunile convenționale de piață deschisă utilizate pentru punerea în aplicare a politicii monetare, o bancă centrală implementează relaxarea cantitativă prin achiziționarea de active financiare de la băncile comerciale și de la alte instituții financiare, crescând astfel prețurile acestor active financiare și scăzând randamentul acestora, în timp ce crește în același timp oferta de bani. Cu toate acestea, spre deosebire de politica normală, relaxarea cantitativă implică, de obicei, achiziționarea de active mai riscante sau pe termen mai lung (mai degrabă decât obligațiuni guvernamentale pe termen scurt) cu sume predeterminate la scară largă, pe o perioadă de timp prestabilită.  Băncile centrale recurg de obicei la relaxarea cantitativă atunci când rata lor nominală a dobânzii se apropie de sau atinge zero. Ratele de dobândă foarte scăzute induc o capcană a lichidității, o situație în care oamenii preferă să dețină numerar sau active foarte lichide, având în vedere randamentele scăzute ale altor active financiare. Acest lucru face dificil ca ratele dobânzii să scadă sub zero; autoritățile monetare pot utiliza apoi relaxarea cantitativă pentru a stimula în continuare economia, mai degrabă decât să încerce să reducă în continuare rata dobânzii.  Easingul cantitativ poate contribui la scoaterea economiei din recesiune și la asigurarea faptului că inflația nu scade sub obiectivul de inflație al băncii centrale. Cu toate acestea, programele de QE sunt, de asemenea, criticate pentru efectele și riscurile lor secundare, care includ politica de a fi mai eficientă decât intenționată în acțiunea împotriva deflației (care duce la o inflație mai mare pe termen lung) sau de a nu fi suficient de eficientă dacă băncile rămân reticente în a împrumuta și potențialii împrumutători nu sunt dispuși să împrumute. Ușurarea cantitativă a fost, de asemenea, criticată pentru creșterea prețurilor activelor financiare, contribuind la inegalitate. Ușurarea cantitativă a fost întreprinsă de unele bănci centrale majore din întreaga lume în urma crizei financiare globale din 2007-2008 și din nou ca răspuns la pandemia COVID-19.", "target": "1- Ușurarea cantitativă (QE) este o acțiune de politică monetară în care guvernul cumpără obligațiuni și alte active pentru a menține rata dobânzii pe termen lung la un nivel scăzut pentru a stimula economia.  2- A fost introdusă după marea criză financiară (GFC) din 2008.  3- Contribuie la inegalitate prin creşterea activelor financiare.", "output": " Easingul cantitativ, din motive de politică monetară, este o formă nouă de politică monetară care a intrat în aplicare pe scară largă după criza financiară din 2007-2008.

Coherența spațială permite focalizarea laserului într-un punct strâns, permițând astfel aplicații precum tăierea cu laser și litografia. Coherența spațială permite, de asemenea, ca un fascicul laser să rămână îngust pe distanțe mari (colimare), permițând aplicații cum ar fi punctele laser și lidar (detecție și distanță de lumină). Laserele pot avea, de asemenea, o coerență temporală ridicată, ceea ce le permite să emită lumină cu un spectru foarte îngust. Alternativ, coerența temporală poate fi utilizată pentru a produce pulse de lumină ultrascurtă cu un spectru larg, dar cu o durată de până la o femtosecundă.  Laserele sunt utilizate în discuri optice, imprimante laser, scanere de coduri de bare, instrumente de secvențiere a ADN-ului, comunicații optice cu fibră optică și în spațiu liber, fabricarea de cipuri semiconductoare (fotolitografie), chirurgie cu laser și tratamente pentru piele, materiale de tăiere și sudură, dispozitive militare și de aplicare a legii pentru marcarea țintelor și măsurarea distanței și vitezei, precum și în afișări cu iluminare laser pentru divertisment.

El a fost, de asemenea, nepotul mamei jucătorului NBA John \"Chubby\" Cox. Părinţii lui i-au pus numele după faimoasa carne de vită din Kobe, Japonia, pe care au văzut-o pe meniul unui restaurant. Al doilea nume, Bean, a fost derivat din porecla tatălui său \"Jellybean\". Familia lui Bryant era catolică şi el a fost crescut în această credinţă.  Bryant a început să joace baschet când avea trei ani, iar Lakers au fost echipa lui preferată când a crescut. Când Bryant avea șase ani, tatăl său s-a retras din NBA și s-a mutat cu familia la Rieti în Italia pentru a continua să joace baschet profesionist. După doi ani, s-au mutat mai întâi la Reggio Calabria, apoi la Pistoia și Reggio Emilia. Kobe s-a obişnuit cu noul său stil de viaţă şi a învăţat să vorbească fluent italiană. Îi plăcea în special Reggio Emilia, pe care o considera un loc iubitor și unde s-au făcut unele dintre cele mai bune amintiri din copilărie. Bryant a început să joace baschet în mod serios în timp ce locuia în Reggio Emilia. Bunicul lui Bryant îi trimitea prin e-mail videoclipuri cu meciurile NBA pentru a le studia. O altă sursă de inspirație au fost filmele animate europene despre sport, din care a învățat mai multe despre baschet. Din 1987 până în 1989, tatăl său a jucat pentru Olimpia Basket Pistoia, unde a jucat împreună cu fostul Detroit Pistons Leon Douglas. Kobe a lucrat la meciuri ca băiat de minge și mop și a practicat tragere la pauză, cu Douglas împărtășind: \"La fiecare dintre meciurile noastre la pauză, a fost spectacolul lui Kobe. El ar ieși acolo și a obține împușcat în sus. Ieşeam din vestiar la pauză şi trebuia să-l alungăm de pe teren\".  Bryant a învăţat şi să joace fotbal, iar echipa lui preferată era A.C. Milan. În timpul verii, Bryant se întorcea în Statele Unite pentru a juca într-o ligă de baschet de vară. Când Bryant avea 13 ani, el și familia sa s-au mutat înapoi în Philadelphia, unde s-a înscris în clasa a opta la Bala Cynwyd Middle School.", "target": "În august 1978, Kobe Bryant s-a născut în Philadelphia.

Indivizii, organizațiile și națiunile sunt înzestrate cu sau dobândesc capacități specializate, și fie formează combinații sau comerț pentru a profita de capacitățile altora în plus față de propriile lor. Capacitățile specializate pot include echipamente sau resurse naturale, precum și competențe. Formarea și combinarea echipamentelor și a altor resurse care acționează împreună sunt adesea importante. De exemplu, un individ se poate specializa prin achiziționarea de unelte și abilitățile de a le folosi eficient, la fel cum o organizație se poate specializa prin achiziționarea de echipamente specializate și angajarea sau formarea operatorilor calificați. Diviziunea muncii este motivul comerţului şi sursa interdependenţei economice.  Din punct de vedere istoric, o creștere a diviziunii muncii este asociată cu creșterea producției totale și a comerțului, cu creșterea capitalismului și cu creșterea complexității proceselor industrializate. Conceptul și implementarea diviziunii muncii au fost observate în cultura sumeriană (mesopotamiană) antică, unde atribuirea de locuri de muncă în unele orașe a coincis cu o creștere a comerțului și a interdependenței economice. Diviziunea muncii crește, de asemenea, în general, atât productivitatea producătorului, cât și a lucrătorului individual.  După Revoluția Neolitică, pastoralismul și agricultura au condus la o aprovizionare cu alimente mai fiabilă și mai abundentă, ceea ce a crescut populația și a condus la specializarea muncii, inclusiv noi clase de artizani, războinici și dezvoltarea elitelor. Această specializare a fost promovată de procesul de industrializare și de fabricile din epoca revoluției industriale. În consecință, mulți economiști clasici, precum și unii ingineri mecanici, cum ar fi Charles Babbage, au fost susținători ai diviziunii muncii. De asemenea, angajarea lucrătorilor pentru a îndeplini sarcini unice sau limitate a eliminat perioada lungă de formare necesară pentru instruirea meșteșugarilor, care au fost înlocuiți cu lucrători necalificați mai puțin plătiți, dar mai productivi.", "target": "În general, următoarele beneficii sunt asociate cu creșterea diviziunii muncii: - creșterea schimburilor comerciale totale - creşterea producţiei totale - o creștere a activității pieței - specializare sporită - creșterea complexității proceselor industrializate", "output": "În consecință, o creștere a diviziunii muncii este asociată cu creșterea capitalismului și complexității proceselor industrializate.

Este cea mai mare dintre cele patru țări constitutive ale Regatului Țărilor de Jos. Țările de Jos sunt alcătuite din douăsprezece provincii; granițează cu Germania la est și cu Belgia la sud, cu o coastă a Mării Nordului la nord și la vest. Ea împărtășește frontiere maritime cu Regatul Unit, Germania și Belgia în Marea Nordului. Limba oficială a țării este olandeza, iar limba frisonă occidentală este o limbă oficială secundară în provincia Friesland. Olandeza, engleza și papiamento sunt oficiale în teritoriile din Caraibe.   Cele patru cele mai mari orașe din Țările de Jos sunt Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Haga și Utrecht. Amsterdam este cel mai populat oraș al țării și capitala nominală. La Haga se află sediul Statelor Generale, al Cabinetului și al Curții Supreme. Portul din Rotterdam este cel mai aglomerat port maritim din Europa. Schiphol este cel mai aglomerat aeroport din Țările de Jos și al treilea cel mai aglomerat aeroport din Europa. Olanda este membru fondator al Uniunii Europene, al zonei euro, al G10, al NATO, al OCDE și al OMC, precum și parte a spațiului Schengen și a Uniunii trilaterale Benelux. Acesta găzduiește mai multe organizații interguvernamentale și instanțe internaționale, multe dintre ele având sediul la Haga.   Țările de Jos înseamnă literalmente \"țări inferioare\", referindu-se la înălțimea scăzută și la topografia plată, cu aproape 26% care se încadrează sub nivelul mării. Majoritatea zonelor de sub nivelul mării, cunoscute sub numele de polder, sunt rezultatul reclamării terenurilor care a început în secolul al XIV-lea. În perioada republicană, care a început în 1588, Țările de Jos au intrat într-o epocă unică de măreție politică, economică și culturală, clasată printre cele mai puternice și influente din Europa și din lume; această perioadă este cunoscută sub numele de Epoca de Aur Olandeză. În acest timp, companiile comerciale olandeze, Compania Olandeză a Indiilor de Est şi Compania Olandeză a Indiilor de Vest, au stabilit colonii şi posturi comerciale în întreaga lume.

Unele chiar le folosesc pentru a-şi păzi verişorii mai mici, alpaca. Acestea sunt utilizate cel mai frecvent în regiunile vestice ale Statelor Unite, unde predatorii mai mari, cum ar fi coioții și câinii sălbatici, sunt prezenți. În mod obișnuit, se folosește un singur castrat (mascul castrat).  Cercetările sugerează că utilizarea mai multor lame de pază nu este la fel de eficientă ca una. Mai mulţi masculi tind să se ataşeze unii de alţii, mai degrabă decât de vite, şi pot ignora turma. Un mascul de doi ani se leagă strâns de noile sale victime şi este foarte eficient în prevenirea prădătorilor. Se pare că unele lame se ataşează mai repede de oi sau de capre dacă sunt introduse cu puţin timp înainte de naştere. Mulți producători de oi și capre indică faptul că se dezvoltă rapid o legătură specială între mieluși și lama lor de pază, iar lama este deosebit de protectoare față de mieluși.  Utilizarea lamai ca paznici a redus pierderile în faţa prădătorilor pentru mulţi producători. Valoarea animalelor salvate în fiecare an depăşeşte cu mult costul de cumpărare şi întreţinerea anuală a unei lame.
