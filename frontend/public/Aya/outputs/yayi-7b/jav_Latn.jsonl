Aku ngerti yen aku kudu mesthekake yen kura-kura aku dipangan kanthi apik, tetep ing suhu sing tepat, diwenehi kesempatan kanggo ngrasakake lampu sing digawe panas utawa ing sinar srengenge yen cukup anget. Aku gelem banget menehi wektu lan komitmen sing dibutuhake kanggo ngurus kura-kura. Kura-kura bakal dadi tanggung jawabku lan aku rumangsa cukup diwasa kanggo ngurus lan seneng.

Kura-kura pancen bisa ngopeni awake dhewe. Asal diwenehi papan sing anget kanggo berjemur, akses menyang banyu seger lan akeh panganan seger kayata dandelions, kale, salad lan sayuran godhong liyane, dheweke seneng banget ditinggalake.

Nyatane, sawijining panliten nuduhake yen kura-kura bisa ngenali pamilik sadurunge sing wis pirang-pirang taun ora katon, mula dheweke ramah lan cerdas banget. Sampeyan bisa uga kuwatir bab hibernating penyu nanging aku wis rampung kathah riset ing iki lan saiki ngerti persis apa apa. Yen kita tuku kura-kura, iku kudu hibernate kanggo maksimum telung sasi saka mburi September. Kita kudu hibernate penyu kita ing kothak uga terisolasi. Suhu ora kudu munggah utawa mudhun 5 derajat celsius lan garasi kita bakal dadi papan sing sampurna kanggo iku. Kita duwe pengukur suhu ing kono supaya aku bisa ngawasi tingkat panas.

Miturut Rijksoverheid, rekor 74,000 kasus dikonfirmasi ing Walanda tanggal 28 Januari, kanthi mung sepuluh ICU utawa pati sing gegandhengan karo corona (<unk>Infeksi- Kasus sing Dikonfirmasi<unk>, 2022). Iki nuwuhake debat: apa pamrentah kudu terus ngetrapake langkah-langkah kasebut utawa ora? Kanggo ngrumusake wangsulan, luwih dhisik kudu ngerti virus lan cara nyebar, lan banjur nimbang debat saka perspektif politik, etika, sosial lan ekonomi. Kasus SARS-CoV-2 sing pertama dilaporake, sing nyebabake penyakit COVID-19, yaiku tanggal 31 Desember 2019 (\"penyakit Coronavirus\", 2022), lan nyebabake reaksi rantai ketidakstabilan politik ing saindenging jagad. Apa sing pisanan diwiwiti minangka epidemi ing China wis tekan meh kabeh negara ing saindenging jagad sajrone pirang-pirang wulan. Sajrone 20 taun kepungkur, akeh negara sing kena pengaruh virus sing ana gandhengane karo Covid-19 kayata SARS. Merga wis tau ngalami kuwi, wong-wong kuwi langsung nggawé keputusan sing cocog. Contone, China ora duwe luwih saka 110,000 kasus wiwit wiwitan pandemi, sanajan meh duwe populasi 1.5 milyar (Worldometer, 2022). Nanging, negara sing kurang stabil ing politik, kayata Turki, kurang siyap lan ngalami 12 yuta kasus, sanajan duwe pedunung 85 yuta. Virus nyebar kanthi cepet amarga mekanisme transmisi udara. Yen ana wong sing cedhak karo wong sing kena infeksi, ambegan saka pembawa kasebut bisa nggawa virus lan bisa dihirup dening individu sing sehat. Nganggo topeng lan njaga jarak mbantu nyegah individu sing kena infeksi nyebar partikel virus ing sekitar wong sing sehat. Nanging, ing negara-negara sing ora ngetrapake langkah-langkah kasebut, ana kenaikan gedhe ing kematian sing gedhe banget. Varian omicron anyar kabukten nyebar paling ora 20 kaping luwih cepet tinimbang galur asli amarga 30 mutasi (Grossman lan Stahel, 2022). Untunge, uga kurang mbebayani amarga ora nyerang jaringan paru-paru ing tahap awal (Zimmer lan Ghorayshi, 2021). Siji uga bisa nganalisa watesan koronavirus saka perspektif etika: apa kita kudu nyuda langkah-langkah corona sanajan nglakoni bisa nyebabake luwih akeh nyawa? Ing tanggal 28 Januari 2021, coronavirus duwé tingkat kematian 0.51%. Iki relatif dhuwur dibandhingake karo virus pernapasan liyane kayata influenza, sing duwe tingkat kematian 0,01%. COVID-19 ora proporsional mengaruhi klompok sing rentan, kayata sing duwe kondisi kesehatan sing ndasari kayata diabetes, obesitas, utawa penyakit autoimun. Iki utamane bener ing wong tuwa, amarga tambah akeh kahanan kesehatan uga sistem kekebalan awak sing saya suwe saya suwe. Coronavirus nginfèksi saluran pernapasan ndhuwur, kalebu paru-paru. Iki ngrusak sel lan mrentah supaya nggawe salinan virus. Sel kasebut banjur pecah lan ngirim salinan virus anyar menyang sel liyane. Pungkasane, yen ora ana respon imun sing efektif, pasien bakal tiwas amarga karusakan paru-paru, utamane karo galur COVID-19 sadurunge varian Omicron. Sajrone kunci, ana kontak manungsa minimal, sing nyuda panyebaran virus. Nanging, nyegah kontak sosial duwe efek sing ngrusak dhewe. Contone, sajrone kunci ana luwih saka 2.5 yuta bocah sing duwe risiko ketinggalan sinau (<unk>Jongeren<unk> 2021') (\"Pendhidhikan lan COVID-19\", 2022). Salajengipun, miturut OSF Healthcare, <unk>Rata-rata kunjungan mingguan menyang departemen darurat amarga dicurigai nyoba bunuh diri ing antarane bocah-bocah wadon enom luwih saka 50% saka periode sing padha taun kepungkur<unk> (OSF Health Care, 2021). Dadi, sanajan luwih akeh nyawa sing ana ing bebaya, kanthi njupuk langkah ekstra kanggo wong-wong sing ana ing klompok risiko, bisa mbukak maneh masarakat kanthi aman lan nyegah bunuh diri lan cacat sinau ing para mudha. Kajaba iku, vaksin bisa nyegah karusakan utama ing jaringan supaya ora kedadeyan ing wiwitan. Saka perspektif sosial, coronavirus wis kabukten minangka <unk>masalah pecahan<unk>, meksa sawetara wong menyang penolakan vaksin. Akeh warga sing ora gelem divaksinasi tanpa ngerti konsekuensine. Ana rong jinis vaksin: mRNA lan vektor virus. Vaksin mRNA COVID-19 minangka vaksin mRNA pisanan sing digunakake ing masarakat umum. Vaksin mRNA duwe RNA ing lipid sing mbantu RNA mlebu sel. Ribosom maca RNA lan mrentah sel kanggo nggawe protein spike sing padha karo SARS-CoV-2. Awak banjur ngakoni manawa protein lonjakan Corona minangka penyerbu lan nggawe antibodi kanggo ngrusak. Yen dibandhingake, vaksin vektor virus nglebokake salinan virus sing ora mbebayani kanthi DNA protein spike sing padha, nyebabake sistem kekebalan awak nyerang lan ngelingi. Kanggo loro jinis vaksin, sel B memori bakal terus nggawe antibodi yen wong kasebut kena virus nyata ing mbesuk. Miturut Dr. Stahel, <unk>Omicron wis ngalami mutasi nganti kurang afinitas ing babagan antibodi saka vaksin sing ngakoni, mula, wangsulane yaiku tembakan booster, amarga sampeyan bakal ngatasi virus kanthi jumlah respon kekebalan sanajan ora ana sing cocog banget<unk> (Grossman lan Stahel, 2022). Mangkono, dosis vaksin asli lan, bubar, suntikan booster duwe peran penting kanggo nyegah infeksi, nanging sing luwih penting kanggo nyuda kemungkinan penyakit lan pati sing parah. Nanging, panliten anyar nuduhake manawa kekebalan sing efektif bisa ilang sajrone nem wulan, saengga kudu entuk dosis taunan, padha karo influenza (Doucleff). 13.6% saka populasi luwih saka 18 nolak divaksinasi, utamane amarga ora percaya karo pamrentah (<unk>Vaccinations COVID-19 vaccinations<unk>, 2022). Iki mbatesi efek kekebalan kawanan, sawijining konsep yen yen cukup wong divaksinasi virus ora bakal bisa nyebar maneh amarga kabeh target kebal. Pungkasan, siji kudu nimbang implikasi ekonomi kunci. Kunci kasebut nyebabake pengangguran sing gedhe banget, utamane kanggo wong-wong sing kerja ing industri lelungan. Contone, miturut forum ekonomi donya, 114 yuta wong kelangan pakaryan ing taun 2020 (Richter, 2021). Kajaba iku, kunci ing saindenging jagad uga nyebabake kira-kira 3,2 triliun euro kerugian ing penghasilan tenaga kerja. Sanajan ana efek ekonomi sing ngrusak, siji kudu nganggep kasunyatan manawa urip dadi taruhan nalika langkah-langkah corona sing tepat ora ditindakake. Miturut NPR, bakal ana kira-kira 488 kaping jumlah kasus ing China yen langkah-langkah sing ora cukup ditindakake, mula bisa nylametake mayuta-yuta nyawa (Beaubien, 2020). Ing kesimpulan, kanthi nimbang COVID-19 saka lensa politik, etis, sosial lan ekonomi, aku nyimpulake manawa sanajan virus kasebut contagious banget lan fatal tumrap klompok tartamtu, kunci mung minangka solusi sementara. Penguncian mung migunani kanggo masarakat kita yen tingkat kematian sing gedhe banget wiwit mundhak. Mula, kanthi njupuk langkah-langkah awal, negara bisa mbatesi panyebaran virus kasebut. Contone, butuh nem wulan sadurunge nganggo topeng dianggep minangka langkah sing bisa ditindakake. Kaya sing katon ing kunci pisanan, puluhan ewu wong kelangan pakaryan lan luwih saka 2.5 yuta bocah kudu sinau jarak jauh ing Walanda (\"Jongeren\", 2021). Mangkono, kanthi njupuk langkah-langkah ing wektu lan siyap, siji ora kudu dikunci. Nanging, yen kematian wiwit saya akeh, mula kudu ngetrapake langkah-langkah korona sing proporsional.", "output": ""}

Teks Mesir kuna sing tanggal saka 2750 SM diarani iwak iki minangka \"Thunderer of the Nile\", lan nggambarake minangka \"pangreksa\" kabeh iwak liyane. Iwak listrik dilaporake maneh ewonan taun mengko dening naturalis lan dokter Yunani, Romawi lan Arab kuno. Sawetara panulis kuna, kayata Pliny the Elder lan Scribonius Largus, nyekseni efek numbing saka kejutan listrik sing dikirim dening catfish listrik lan sinar listrik, lan ngerti yen kejutan kasebut bisa lelungan ing sadawane obyek konduktif. Pasien sing nandhang penyakit kaya asam urat utawa sirah diarahake kanggo ndemek iwak listrik kanthi pangarep-arep yen geter sing kuat bisa ngobati. Budaya kuna ing sekitar Mediterania ngerti manawa obyek tartamtu, kayata batang amber, bisa digosok nganggo wulu kucing kanggo narik obyek cahya kaya wulu. Thales saka Miletus nggawe serangkaian pengamatan babagan listrik statis udakara 600 SM, saka dheweke percaya manawa gesekan nggawe amber magnetik, beda karo mineral kayata magnetit, sing ora mbutuhake gesekan. Thales salah nalika percaya yen daya tarik kasebut amarga efek magnetik, nanging ilmu pengetahuan mengko bakal mbuktekake hubungan antara magnetisme lan listrik. Miturut teori kontroversial, wong Parthia bisa uga duwe kawruh babagan galvanis, adhedhasar panemuan Baterai Baghdad taun 1936, sing kaya sel galvanis, sanajan ora yakin manawa artefak kasebut listrik. Listrik bakal tetep sethitik luwih saka penasaran intelektual kanggo millennia nganti 1600, nalika ilmuwan Inggris William Gilbert nulis De Magnete, ing ngendi dheweke nggawe studi sing tliti babagan listrik lan magnetisme, mbedakake efek lodestone saka listrik statis sing diasilake kanthi ngusap amber. Piyambakipun damel tembung Latin énggal electricus (\"saka amber\" utawa \"kaya amber\", elektron, tembung Yunani kanggo \"amber\") kanggo ngrujuk marang sifat narik obyek cilik sawise digosok. Asosiasi iki nyebabake tembung Inggris \"listrik\" lan \"listrik\", sing pisanan muncul ing cetakan ing Pseudodoxia Epidemica Thomas Browne taun 1646. Pakaryan luwih lanjut ditindakake ing abad kaping 17 lan wiwitan abad kaping 18 dening Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray lan C. F. du Fay. Ing pungkasan abad kaping 18, Benjamin Franklin nganakaké panalitèn kang ekstensif bab listrik, kanthi ngedol bandhané kanggo mbiayai karyané. Ing wulan Juni 1752, dheweke misuwur amarga nempel kunci logam ing sisih ngisor senar layang-layang sing lembab lan mabur layang-layang ing langit sing diancam badai. Sekumpulan petir sing mlumpat saka kunci menyang mburi tangane nuduhake yen petir pancen listrik. Dhèwèké uga njelasaké prilaku sing paradoxical jar Leyden minangka piranti kanggo nyimpen jumlah gedhe saka daya listrik ing syarat-syarat listrik dumadi saka loro daya positif lan negatif Ing taun 1775, Hugh Williamson nglaporake serangkaian eksperimen menyang Royal Society babagan kejut sing dikirim dening belut listrik; ing taun sing padha, ahli bedah lan anatomis John Hunter nggambarake struktur organ listrik iwak kasebut. Ing taun 1791, Luigi Galvani nerbitaké panemoné babagan bioelektromagnetik, sing nduduhaké yèn listrik kuwi sarana sing digunakaké neuron kanggo ngirim sinyal menyang otot. Baterai utawa tumpukan voltase Alessandro Volta, taun 1800, digawe saka lapisan seng lan tembaga sing gantian, nyedhiyakake para ilmuwan kanthi sumber energi listrik sing luwih dipercaya tinimbang mesin elektrostatik sing digunakake sadurunge. Pengakuan elektromagnetisme, kesatuan fenomena listrik lan magnetik, amarga Hans Christian Ørsted lan André-Marie Ampère ing taun 1819-1820. Michael Faraday nemokaké motor listrik ing taun 1821, lan Georg Ohm nganalisa sirkuit listrik kanthi matematis ing taun 1827. Listrik lan magnetisme (lan cahya) wis ana gandhengane karo James Clerk Maxwell, utamane ing \"On Physical Lines of Force\" ing taun 1861 lan 1862.  Nalika wiwitan abad kaping 19 wis nyumurupi kemajuan sing cepet ing ilmu listrik, pungkasan abad kaping 19 bakal ndeleng kemajuan paling gedhe ing teknik listrik. Liwat wong-wong kaya Alexander Graham Bell, Ottó Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla lan George Westinghouse, listrik malih saka penasaran ilmiah dadi alat penting kanggo urip modern. Ing taun 1887, Heinrich Hertz nemokaké yèn èlèktrod sing diiluminasi kanthi cahya ultraviolet luwih gampang nggawé percikan listrik. Ing taun 1905, Albert Einstein nerbitake makalah sing nerangake data eksperimen saka efek fotoelektrik minangka asil energi cahya sing digawa ing paket kuantis diskrit, menehi energi elektron. Penemuan iki nyebabake revolusi kuantum. Einstein dianugerahi Bebungah Nobel babagan Fisika ing taun 1921 kanggo \"penemuan hukum efek fotoelektrik\". Efek fotoelektrik uga digunakake ing sel foto kayata sing bisa ditemokake ing panel surya. Piranti solid-state pisanan yaiku \"detektor kumis kucing\" sing pisanan digunakake ing taun 1900-an ing panrima radio. Kawat kaya kumis dilebokake kanthi kontak karo kristal padhet (kayata kristal germanium) kanggo ndeteksi sinyal radio kanthi efek sambungan kontak. Ing komponen solid-state, arus kasebut diwatesi kanggo unsur-unsur padhet lan senyawa sing direkayasa khusus kanggo ngalih lan nguatake. Aliran arus bisa dingerteni kanthi rong wujud: minangka elektron sing diisi negatif, lan minangka kekurangan elektron sing diisi positif sing diarani bolongan. Beban lan bolongan iki dimangertèni ing babagan fisika kuantum. Bahan bangunan paling asring minangka semikonduktor kristal. Elektronik solid-state muncul kanthi munculé teknologi transistor. Transistor pisanan sing bisa digunakake, yaiku transistor titik kontak adhedhasar germanium, ditemokake dening John Bardeen lan Walter Houser Brattain ing Bell Labs ing taun 1947, banjur transistor persimpangan bipolar ing taun 1948.", "target": "Piranti solid-state pisanan yaiku \"detektor kumis kucing\" sing pisanan digunakake ing taun 1900-an ing panrima radio.

Pengaruh penting liyane yaiku panulis prosa lan puisi lan pahlawan nasional Kuba, Jose Martí. Unsur pungkasan sing nemtokake estetika Darianian yaiku kekagumane marang para simbolis, utamane Paul Verlaine. Recapitulating lintasan puitis dhewe ing puisi awal Cantos de vida y esperanza (1905) Darío dhewe nyintesis pengaruh utamane nalika negesake manawa dheweke \"kuat karo Hugo lan ambigu karo Verlaine\" (\"con Hugo fuerte y con Verlaine ambiguo\".)  Ing bagean \"Palabras Liminares\" saka Prosas Profanas (1896) dheweke wis nulis paragraf sing nuduhake pentinge budaya Prancis ing pangembangan karyane sastra:  Wong tuwa Spanyol kanthi jenggot putih nuduhake seri potret sing misuwur: \"Iki - jarene - yaiku Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra sing hebat, jenius siji tangan; iki Lope de Vega, iki Garcilaso, iki Quintana. \" Aku nyuwun marang wong sing mulya Gracián, kanggo Teresa saka Ávila, kanggo Góngora sing gagah lan sing paling kuat, Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas. Banjur aku ngomong: \"Shakespeare! Dante! - Aku ora ngerti! Hugo...! (lan ing sirahku: Verlaine...!) \" Banjur, nalika pamitan: \"-Old man, iku penting kanggo ngomong: bojoku saka tanah sandi; mistress sandi saka Paris. \"  Los raros minangka volume ilustrasi babagan selera sastra, sing diterbitake ing taun sing padha karo Prosas profanas, lan darmabakti kanthi ringkes sawetara panulis lan intelektual sing dheweke rumangsa gumun banget.

Ing wulan Maret 1948, aliansi iki ditambahi ing Prajanjian Brussels kanggo nyakup negara-negara Benelux, mbentuk Organisasi Prajanjian Brussels, sing umume dikenal minangka Uni Kulon.

Rembugan kasebut nyebabake penandatanganan Perjanjian Atlantik Lor tanggal 4 April 1949 dening negara-negara anggota Western Union ditambah Amerika Serikat, Kanada, Portugal, Italia, Norwegia, Denmark, lan Islandia. Diplomat Kanada Lester B. Pearson minangka panulis utama lan panyusun perjanjian kasebut.
