Therefore, it is important to limit the amount of nitrites and nitrates in your diet and to avoid consuming excessive amounts of these compounds. The American Heart Association recommends that adults limit their intake of nitrites and nitrates to no more than 30 mg of nitrites and 10 mg of nitrates per day. This is equivalent to a serving size of red meat or fish, which is typically around 100 grams.

Mwen okouran ke gen yon bèt kay se yon gwo angajman Se konsa, mwen ekri ou eksplike poukisa mwen panse ou ta dwe achte m 'yon tòti bèt kay ak poukisa yon tòti se yon chwa kokenn nan bèt kay.  Pran swen yon tòti bèt kay ap ban m yon gwo sans responsablite. Mwen konnen ke mwen pral gen asire ke tòti mwen an se byen manje, kenbe nan tanperati a dwa, bay opòtinite yo chofe anba yon lanp chofe oswa nan solèy la si cho ase. Mwen trè vle bay tan an ak angajman ki nesesè pou pran swen tòti mwen an. Tòtò a pral sèl responsablite mwen e mwen santi mwen ase matirite pou m angaje m nan swen li ak kontantman li.  Kòm ou konnen, mwen soufri de enkyetid ak lekòl la fè m patikilyèman enkyete pafwa. Li te montre nan anpil etid ke bèt kay diminye enkyetid ak estrès nan moun. Mwen santi mwen sèten ke gen yon tòti pral yon distraksyon kokenn soti nan enkyetid mwen epi pote m 'gwo plezi. Kontrèman ak kwayans popilè, tòti renmen gen kokiy yo caressed ak chèn yo chatling e mwen panse ke li ta dwe trè rilaks pou m 'to pet yon tòti lè mwen rive lakay ou soti nan lekòl la.  Turtles yo trè pwòp tèt ou-ki ase. Toutotan yo bay yon kote cho pou chofe, aksè nan dlo fre ak anpil manje fre tankou pyonye, kale, letye ak lòt legim fèy, yo trè kontan yo dwe kite nan pwòp aparèy yo. Kòm nou ap viv nan UK a kote tanperati yo ka fre, nou ta bezwen achte yon tab tòti ak bon substra, yon lanp sunning ak kèk po kote tòti a ka rantre tèt li lwen. Nou gen anpil plas pou sa nan kwizin nou an. Lè li cho, tòti a ka antre nan jaden nou an nan yon kaj. Yon tab tòti ak lanp ap koute apeprè £200 men sa a se jis yon depans inisyal. Apre sa, kenbe yon tòti se trè bon mache. An reyalite, ou ka chwazi pi fò nan manje yo pou gratis pa forage ki mwen kontan fè lè nou ale pou fanmi mache.  Kontrèman ak kwayans popilè, tòti ka trè zanmitay. Kòm mwen te mansyone pi wo a, yo renmen ke yo te manyen men ou te konnen tou ke yo ka rekonèt mèt yo ak kèk ka menm reponn a non yo? An reyalite, yon etid te montre ke tòti ka rekonèt mèt kay anvan yo ke yo pa t wè nan ane konsa yo tou de zanmitay ak trè entelijan. Ou ka enkyete w sou hibernation yon tòti men mwen te fè anpil rechèch sou sa a e kounye a konnen egzakteman sa pou fè. Si nou achte yon tòti, li pral bezwen hibernate pou yon maksimòm de twa mwa soti nan fen mwa septanm nan. Nou pral bezwen hibernate tòti nou an nan yon bwat byen izole. Tanperati a pa dwe ale pi wo oswa pi ba pase 5 degre Sèlsiyis ak garaj nou an ta dwe plas la pafè pou li. Nou gen yon manomèt tanperati la pou mwen ka kenbe yon je sou nivo chalè a.  Finalman, mwen te gade nan depans pou achte yon tòti. Mwen ta sijere nou achte yon tòti ki gen yon koup ane ki gen laj kòm yo mande pou mwens swen. Nou ka achte yon tòto pre-renmen ki te microchiped pou apeprè £ 100. Epi lè nou ale an vakans, mwen te jwenn yon otèl tòti ki te kouri pa yon veterinè ak koute sèlman £ 60 pou yon rete 10 jou.  Mwen panse ke ou pral dakò ke mwen te fè yon rechèch trè bon nèt nan pran swen nan yon tòti e mwen espere ou pral dakò ke mwen se kounye a ase matirite yo pran swen nan yon bèt kay. Mwen vrèman kwè ke yon tòti bèt kay pral ban m 'yon sans fò nan responsablite epi yo pral gen yon efè pozitif kalman sou atitid mwen. Anfèt, mwen panse tout fanmi an ap jwi gen yon tòti. Yo se zanmitay, renmen, enteresan ak entelijan bèt ak nou tout ap benefisye de gen yon sèl.  Mwen ta rekonesan si ou ta bay demann mwen an plen konsiderasyon.  Anpil lanmou,  Wilf x", "output": ".

Dapre Rijksoverheid, yon dosye 74,000 ka yo te konfime nan Netherlands sou 28 janvye, ak jis dis koronavirus ki gen rapò ak ICU admisyon oswa lanmò (<unk> Enfeksyon- Ka konfime<unk>, 2022). Sa leve yon deba: èske gouvènman an ta dwe kontinye fè respekte mezi sa yo ou pa? Pou kapab fòmile yon repons, yon moun dwe premye konprann viris la ak kijan li gaye, ak Lè sa a, konsidere deba a soti nan politik, etik, sosyal ak ekonomik pèspektiv. Premye ka SARS-CoV-2 ki te rapòte, ki lakòz maladi COVID-19, se te 31 desanm 2019 (\"maladi Coronavirus\", 2022), e li te kòmanse yon reyaksyon chèn nan enstabilite politik atravè lemond. Sa ki te kòmanse kòm yon epidemi nan peyi Lachin te rive nan prèske tout peyi nan mond lan nan kèk mwa. Nan 20 dènye ane yo, anpil peyi te afekte pa viris ki gen rapò ak COVID-19 tankou SARS. Akòz eksperyans yo te genyen anvan an, yo te pran mezi ki apwopriye imedyatman. Pa egzanp, Lachin pa gen plis pase 110,000 ka depi kòmansman pandemi an, menm si li gen prèske yon popilasyon 1.5 milya (Worldometer, 2022). Sepandan, yon peyi ki gen mwens estabilite politik, tankou Latiki, te mwens prepare e li te soufri 12 milyon ka, menmsi li gen yon popilasyon 85 milyon. Viris la gaye trè vit akòz mekanis transmisyon lè li. Si yon moun pre yon moun ki enfekte, èkshalasyon moun ki pote viris la ka pote viris la epi moun ki an sante ka respire li. Mete yon mask ak kenbe distans ede anpeche moun ki enfekte yo gaye patikil viris nan vwazinaj moun ki an sante. Sepandan, nan peyi kote mezi yo pa te aplike, te gen yon gwo ogmantasyon nan lanmò twòp. Nouvo varyant omikron la pwouve ke li gaye omwen 20 fwa pi vit pase souch orijinal la paske li gen 30 mitasyon (Grossman ak Stahel, 2022). Erezman, li se tou byen lwen mwens danjere paske li pa atake tisi nan poumon nan premye etap li yo (Zimmer ak Ghorayshi, 2021). Yon moun kapab analize tou restriksyon koronavirus yo nan yon pèspektiv etik: èske nou ta dwe bese mezi koronavirus yo menm si fè sa ka mete plis lavi nan risk? Kòm nan 28 janvye 2021, kowonaviris la gen yon pousantaj lanmò nan 0.51%. Sa a se relativman wo konpare ak lòt viris respiratwa tankou grip, ki gen yon to mòtalite nan 0.01%. COVID-19 afekte disproporsyonèlman gwoup vilnerab, tankou moun ki gen kondisyon sante ki kache tankou dyabèt, obezite, oswa maladi otoiminitè. Sa a se laverite espesyalman nan granmoun aje, paske nan kantite a ogmante nan kondisyon sante kòm byen ke yon sistèm iminitè deteryore ak laj. Kowonaviris la enfekte aparèy respiratwa anwo a, ki gen ladan poumon yo. Li kraze nan selil yo epi li ba yo lòd pou yo kreye kopi viris la. Lè sa a, selil la kraze epi li voye nouvo kopi viris la nan direksyon lòt selil yo. Evantyèlman, si pa gen yon repons efikas iminitè, pasyan an ap mouri akòz domaj nan poumon, espesyalman ak tansyon COVID-19 anvan Variant Omicron la. Pandan yon blokaj, gen kontak imen minimòm, ki ralanti pwopagasyon viris la. Sepandan, anpeche kontak sosyal gen pwòp efè devastatè li yo. Pa egzanp, pandan blokaj la te gen plis pase 2.5 milyon timoun ki te nan risk pou yo tonbe dèyè nan aprantisaj (<unk>Jongeren<unk> 2021') (\"Education and COVID-19\", 2022). Anplis de sa, dapre OSF Healthcare, \"Vizit mwayèn chak semèn nan depatman ijans pou sispèk tantativ swisid nan mitan jèn ti fi yo te moute plis pase 50% konpare ak menm peryòd la yon ane de sa\" (OSF Health Care, 2021). Se konsa, menm si plis lavi yo mete an danje, pa pran mezi siplemantè pou moun ki nan gwoup risk la, yon moun ka san danje relouvri sosyete a ak anpeche swisid ak andikap aprantisaj nan jèn yo. Anplis de sa, vaksen ka anpeche gwo domaj nan tisi rive an premye. Soti nan yon pèspektiv sosyete, kowonaviris te pwouve ke li se yon \" pwoblèm ki divize \", ki pouse kèk moun nan refi vaksen. Anpil sitwayen pa pran vaksen san yo pa vrèman konprann konsekans yo. Gen de kalite vaksen: mRNA ak vektè viral. Vaksen mRNA COVID-19 la te premye vaksen mRNA ki te itilize nan piblik la an jeneral. Vaksen mRNA yo gen RNA andedan lipid ki ede RNA antre nan selil la. Ribosòm yo li RNA a epi enstwi selil yo pou yo fè menm pwoteyin pik yo tankou SARS-CoV-2. Kò a Lè sa a, rekonèt ke pwoteyin Corona Spike yo se anvayisè ak kreye antikò pou detwi yo. Nan konparezon, vaksen vektè viral mete yon kopi inofansif nan viris la ak menm ADN pwoteyin pik la, sa ki lakòz sistèm iminitè a atake li epi sonje li. Pou tou de kalite vaksen yo, selil B memwa yo ap kontinye kreye antikò pou ka moun nan ekspoze a viris reyèl la nan lavni. Dapre Dr. Stahel, <unk>Omicron te muté anpil ke li gen mwens afinite an tèm de antikò yo soti nan vaksen an rekonèt li, se konsa, Se poutèt sa, repons lan se piki rapèl la, paske ou pral akablan viris la ak kantite repons iminitè a menm si pa gen yon matche parfe<unk> (Grossman ak Stahel, 2022). Se konsa, dòz orijinal vaksen an ak, pi resamman, piki rapèl la jwe yon wòl enpòtan nan anpeche enfeksyon, men pi enpòtan nan diminye chans pou maladi grav ak lanmò. Sepandan, nouvo etid yo te montre ke iminite efikas ka disparèt nan lespas sis mwa, sa ki fè li nesesè pou jwenn dòz anyèl, menm jan ak grip (Doucleff). 13.6% nan popilasyon ki gen plis pase 18 an refize pran vaksen an, sitou paske yo pa gen konfyans nan gouvènman an (<unk>Vaksinasyon Vaksen COVID-19 <unk>, 2022). Sa limite efè iminite bann bèt yo, yon konsèp kote si ase moun pran vaksen an viris la pap kapab gaye ankò paske tout sib yo iminitè. Finalman, yon moun dwe konsidere enplikasyon ekonomik yo nan yon blokaj. Lockdown la te lakòz chomaj kolosal, espesyalman pou moun ki te travay nan endistri vwayaj la. Pou egzanp, dapre fowòm ekonomik mondyal la, 114 milyon moun pèdi travay yo pandan 2020 (Richter, 2021). Anplis de sa, blokaj yo atravè mond lan te lakòz tou yon pèt estime 3.2 billions ero nan revni travay. Menm ak efè ekonomik devastatè yo, yon moun dwe konsidere lefèt ke lavi yo mete sou risk lè mezi koronavirus apwopriye yo pa pran. Dapre NPR, ta gen apeprè 488 fwa kantite ka nan Lachin si mezi ensifizan yo te pran, kidonk sove dè milyon de lavi (Beaubien, 2020). An konklizyon, pa konsidere COVID-19 soti nan yon politik, etik, sosyal ak ekonomik lantiy, mwen konkli ke menm si viris la trè kontajye ak fatal nan direksyon pou sèten gwoup, blokaj yo se sèlman solisyon tanporè. Yon blokaj se sèlman benefisye nan sosyete nou an yon fwa ke mòtalite twòp kòmanse monte. Se poutèt sa, lè peyi yo pran mezi byen bonè, yo ka anpeche viris la gaye. Pa egzanp, li te pran sis mwa anvan yo te wè mete mask kòm yon mezi solid. Kòm nou te wè nan premye blokaj la, dè dizèn de milye de moun pèdi travay yo e plis pase 2.5 milyon timoun te oblije fè aprantisaj aleka nan Netherlands (\"Jongeren\", 2021). Se konsa, pa pran mezi nan tan ak ke yo te prepare, yon moun pa bezwen ale nan fèmen. Sepandan, si lanmò yo kòmanse vin twòp, li vo ranfòse yon kantite pwopòsyonèl mezi koronavirus.", "output": ""}

Men, èske w te remake gen mwens ak mwens chak ane? Lè m te yon timoun, ou pa t 'kapab pran yon vwayaj san yo pa resevwa kèk papiyon sou vè devan machin ou. Se konsa, poukisa gen tèlman kèk e ki sa sa vle di?  Youn nan rezon prensipal yo se itilizasyon pestisid ak èrbisid. Chimik sa yo touye moun san yo pa chwazi. Epi yo frape tout ekosistèm nan soti nan balans. Nan lakou mwen, mwen te wè kijan yon ti pasyans ka mete bagay yo tounen nan balans. Mwen te gen afid, men tou dousman remake predatè afid rezoud pwoblèm nan. Mwen te gen mouch akòz poul mwen an, men sou kèk semèn mwen te wè Swallows ak Phoebes deplase nan pran avantaj de sous manje a.  Lòt rezon ki fè nou wè mwens papiyon se manje pou chen. Pifò papiyon ak mouton (oswa papiyon nan mitan lannwit jan mwen renmen rele yo) bezwen yon plant patikilye pou òganize chen chen yo. Pou papiyon Monarch, se Milkweed (Asclepias), ki se yon non malere pou yon bèl plant. Pou Pipevine Swallowtails, li se Pipevine (Aristolochia). San yo pa plant sa yo, ti chen yo pa gen okenn sous manje. E pandan vil yo ak tout katye yo vin pavé, pa gen okenn kote pou plant sa yo ki te yon fwa abondan yo grandi. Lè nou gade nan lakou pwòp nou, yo gen bèl plant ki enpòte nan lòt kote. Men, pou yon papiyon, lakou nou yo sanble dezè. Menm plant tankou boutèy bwòs, ki atire yon anpil nan ensèk pou nektar, bay pa gen manje pou ti ensèk natif natal. Li se yon jan de gen yon ba pou granmoun yo bwè nan, men pa gen manje pou nouri pitit yo pou yo ka grandi yo dwe granmoun tou.  Men Doug Tallamy, yon entomolog nan Inivèsite Delaware, di nou ka ede. Lè nou mete kèk plant natif natal nan lakou nou, nou ka bay manje pou pote papiyon tounen.  Kòm nou te prepare pou re-fè jaden nou an soti nan tout tan-vèt orneman, nan yon kay angle / jaden flè koupe, yon bagay ki te rive. Nou te wè Doug Tallamy pale nan yon CNPS Silicon Valley Zoom Reyinyon. Epi nou reyalize nou te gen chanje direksyon nou an, ak kòmanse jadinaj ak natif natal.  Pandan n ap gade jaden nou an, nou konnen nou fèk kòmanse... Li se yon gwo eksperyans pou wè sa ki travay kote. E deja jaden an ap pale avèk nou. Zèb ki gen je ble a te pran chemen pavé a pou li ale nan yon lòt pati nan jaden an! Nou espere plis mouvman ak majik nan lavni. Men kèk panse nou genyen sou jaden nou an.  Benediksyon... gen yon pye bwadchenn jeyan nan lakou nou an ak kouran dèyè nou te sètènman te ban nou yon pye anwo an tèm de manje ak aksè bèt sovaj nan lakou nou an.  Dezavantaj... anpil lonbraj. Se sèlman de, petèt twa kote nan jaden nou an ki jwenn bon solèy. Se konsa, nou trol nan Calscape kap chèche plant ki pral tolere lonbraj. (Si ou pa te rankontre Calscape ou nan pou yon trete. Mwen espere ou ap viv nan Kalifòni menm si...).  Objektif... kòm Talamites, nou kwè nan manje ekosistèm nan, ki kòmanse ak agrikilti larva. Se konsa, ki jan sa te mache? Oke, nou te wè sèlman yon sèl oswa de chenmèt byen lwen tèlman. Soupi. Se tout yon eksperyans...  Pi gwo enpak... kite fèy yo ane pase a. Nou ka deja wè tè a amelyore, ak chak fwa nou dlo nou wè yon anpil nan ensèk leve soti nan fatra a. Se sa k ap rive. Tou dousman...  Se konsa, nou kontinye ranplase moun ki pa natif natal ak natif natal. Nan wikenn pase a nou te retire Sarcococca ak Pierris Japonicas e nou te ranplase yo ak Coffeeberry (Frangula Californica). Nan wikenn sa a, nou te koupe de pye maple e nou te ranplase yo ak Anemone Bush (Carpenteria Californica). E wikenn pwochèn nou pral ranplase sèj bwat nou an ak Coyote Brush (Baccharis pilularis).  Anplis ensèk yo, nou te wè anpil lòt gwo bèt sovaj nan lakou nou an. Yon nouvo nich ekirèy ti bebe fèt nan pyebwa a chak ane. Epi ane sa a nou te sezi pa 3 ti raton k ap deplase nan pyebwa a (li se lajman twou san fon).  Yo dous timid ak adorabl.

Travay te konplete nan mwa Out 1940, lè li te komisyone nan flòt Alman an. Bismarck ak sè li bato Tirpitz te pi gwo bato de gè janm bati pa Almay, ak de nan pi gwo bati pa nenpòt pouvwa Ewopeyen an.  Nan kou a nan karyè uit mwa bato a lagè a, Bismarck te fè sèlman yon sèl operasyon ofansif ki te dire 8 jou nan mwa me 1941, kòd rele Rheinübung. Bato a, ansanm ak kwazyè a lou Prinz Eugen, te gen kraze nan Oseyan Atlantik la ak atak Alye anbake soti nan Amerik di Nò nan Grann Bretay. De bato yo te detekte plizyè fwa nan Scandinavia, ak inite naval Britanik yo te deplwaye pou bloke wout yo. Nan batay la nan Denmark Strait, kwazyè a batay HMS Hood okòmansman angaje Prinz Eugen, pwobableman pa erè, pandan y ap HMS Prince of Wales angaje Bismarck. Nan batay la ki te swiv Hood te detwi pa dife a konbine nan Bismarck ak Prinz Eugen, ki Lè sa a, domaje Prince of Wales ak fòse li retrè. Bismarck te soufri ase domaj nan twa frape pa Prince de Wales fòse yon fen nan misyon an anvayi.  Detwi Hood a te ankouraje yon pouswit san rete pa Royal Navy ki enplike plizyè douzèn bato de gè. De jou pita, kap pou okipe Lafrans pou fè reparasyon, Bismarck te atake pa kenz Fairey Swordfish torpedo bonm soti nan avyon konpayi asirans HMS Ark Royal; youn te fè nòt yon frape ki te fè kourè kourè bato de gè a inoperatif.

Answer: no, Bismarck was a German battleship. She was built by the shipyard of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg in 1936 and was launched in 1939. She was completed in 1940 and was commissioned in the Kriegsmarine in May 1939. She sank in the North Atlantic in October 1941, during the operation Rheinübung. She was a key battleship for the German navy during World War II. She was one of the most powerful battleships of her time and was a significant rival to the Royal Navy’s Royal Oak. She was a major destroyer in the Royal Navy's strike force, and was one of the most feared battleships of the war. Despite being damaged by a Royal Air Force (RAF) torpedo attack, she managed to survive and continue her mission until she was sunk by a Royal Navy's strike force. Her name has become synonymous with the era of the German navy during World War II."}

Ansyen tèks moun peyi Lejip yo date de 2750 BCE refere a pwason sa yo kòm \"Thunder of the Nile\", epi dekri yo kòm \"pwotektè\" tout lòt pwason yo. Pwason elektrik yo te rapòte ankò milenèr pita pa ansyen grèk, Women ak Arabi naturalist ak doktè. Plizyè ansyen ekriven, tankou Pliny a Elder ak Scribonius Largus, te ateste efè anmèdan chòk elektrik ki soti nan pwason chat elektrik ak reyon elektrik, e yo te konnen ke chòk sa yo te kapab vwayaje ansanm objè ki kondwi. Pasyan ki gen maladi tankou gout oswa tèt fè mal te dirije yo manyen pwason elektrik nan espwa ke so a pwisan ta ka geri yo. Kilti ansyen alantou Mediterane a te konnen ke sèten objè, tankou baton nan Amber, te kapab fwote ak po chat la pou atire objè limyè tankou plim. Thales nan Miletus te fè yon seri obsèvasyon sou elektrisite estatik alantou 600 BCE, ki soti nan ki li te kwè ke friksyon te fè Amber mayetik, kontrèman ak mineral tankou magnetit, ki pa t 'bezwen fwote. Thales te mal nan kwè atraksyon an te akòz yon efè mayetik, men syans pita ta pwouve yon lyen ant mayetis ak elektrisite. Dapre yon teyori kontwovèsyal, Parthians yo ka te gen konesans nan electroplating, ki baze sou dekouvèt la 1936 nan batri a Bagdad, ki sanble ak yon selil galvanik, byenke li se ensèten si te atifakt la elektrik nan lanati. Elektrisite te rete yon ti kras plis pase yon kiryozite entelektyèl pou milenèr jouk 1600, lè syantis angle William Gilbert te ekri De Magnete, nan ki li te fè yon etid ak anpil atansyon nan elektrisite ak mayetis, distenge efè lodestone a soti nan elektrisite estatik ki te pwodwi pa fwote anbri. Li te kreye nouvo mo Latin electricus (\"nan Amber\" oswa \"tankou Amber\", elektron, mo grèk la pou \"Amber\") pou refere a pwopriyete a nan atire ti objè apre yo te fwote. Asosyasyon sa a te lakòz mo angle \"elektri\" ak \"elektri\", ki te fè premye aparisyon yo nan enprime nan Pseudodoxia Epidemica Thomas Browne a nan 1646. Plis travay te fèt nan 17yèm ak byen bonè 18yèm syèk pa Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray ak C. F. du Fay. Pita nan 18yèm syèk la, Benjamin Franklin te fè anpil rechèch sou elektrisite, li te vann tout byen li pou l te ka finanse travay li a. Nan mwa jen 1752, li te gen repitasyon pou yo te tache yon kle metal nan pati anba a nan yon kòd kite imid ak vole kite a nan yon syèl tanpèt-menase. Yon seri de zèklè sote soti nan kle a nan do a nan men l 'te montre ke zèklè te tout bon elektrik nan lanati. Li te tou eksplike konpòtman an aparamman paradoksal nan Leyden krich la kòm yon aparèy pou estoke gwo kantite chaj elektrik an tèm de elektrisite ki gen ladan tou de chaj pozitif ak negatif An 1775, Hugh Williamson te rapòte yon seri eksperyans nan Royal Society sou chòk yo delivre pa angile elektrik la; menm ane sa a chirijyen an ak anatom John Hunter dekri estrikti a nan ògàn elektrik pwason an. An 1791, Luigi Galvani te pibliye dekouvèt li te fè sou bioélectromagnétique, li te demontre ke elektrisite se mwayen ki fè nè yo pase siyal nan misk yo. Batri Alessandro Volta a, oswa pil voltajik, ki te fèt nan ane 1800 la, te fèt ak kouch zenk ak kwiv ki te fè altène, e li te bay syantis yo yon sous enèji elektrik ki pi serye pase machin elektwo-estatik yo te konn itilize anvan yo. Rekonesans nan elektwomayetik, inite a nan fenomèn elektrik ak mayetik, se akòz Hans Christian Ørsted ak André-Marie Ampère nan 1819-1820. Michael Faraday te envante motè elektrik la an 1821, e Georg Ohm te analize sikwi elektrik la matematikman an 1827. Elektrisite ak mayetism (ak limyè) te definitivman lye pa James Clerk Maxwell, an patikilye nan li \"Sou liy fizik fòs\" nan 1861 ak 1862.  Pandan ke nan kòmansman 19yèm syèk la te wè pwogrè rapid nan syans elektrik, nan fen 19yèm syèk la ta wè pi gwo pwogrè nan jeni elektrik. Atravè moun tankou Alexander Graham Bell, Ottó Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla ak George Westinghouse, elektrisite tounen soti nan yon kiryozite syantifik nan yon zouti esansyèl pou lavi modèn. An 1887, Heinrich Hertz dekouvri ke elektwòd eklere ak limyè iltravyolèt kreye etensèl elektrik pi fasil. An 1905, Albert Einstein te pibliye yon papye ki te eksplike done eksperimantal ki soti nan efè foto-elektrik la kòm rezilta enèji limyè ki te pote nan pakè diskre quantize, ki bay enèji elektwon. Dekouvèt sa a te mennen nan revolisyon quantum la. Einstein te resevwa Pri Nobèl nan Fizik an 1921 pou \"dekouvèt li nan lwa efè foto-elektrik la\". Efè fotoelektrik la tou te itilize nan fotocell tankou ka jwenn nan panno solè. Premye aparèy solid-eta a te \"detektè mous chat la\" premye itilize nan ane 1900 yo nan reseptè radyo. Yon fil ki sanble ak yon moustik mete yon ti kras an kontak ak yon kristal solid (tankou yon kristal germanium) pou detekte yon siyal radyo pa efè junction kontak la. Nan yon eleman solid-eta, aktyèl la limite a eleman solid ak konpoze ki fèt espesyalman pou chanje ak anplifye li. Kouran koule ka konprann nan de fòm: kòm negatif chaje elektwon, ak kòm pozitif chaje elektwon defisyans yo rele twou. Chaj sa yo ak twou yo konprann an tèm de fizik quantum. Materyèl la bilding se pi souvan yon semi-conducteurs cristalline. Elektwonik solid-eta te vini nan pwòp li yo ak Aparisyon nan teknoloji tranzistò. Premye tranzistò k ap travay la, yon tranzistò pwen-kontak ki baze sou germanium, te envante pa John Bardeen ak Walter Houser Brattain nan Bell Labs nan 1947, ki te swiv pa tranzistò junction bipolar nan 1948.", "target": "Premye aparèy solid-eta a te \"detektè mous chat la\" premye itilize nan ane 1900 yo nan reseptè radyo.

Eleman final la defini nan estetik Darianian se admirasyon li nan direksyon pou senbolis yo, espesyalman Paul Verlaine. Rekapitilize pwòp trajectoire powetik li nan powèm inisyal la nan Cantos de vida y esperanza (1905) Darío tèt li sentèz enfliyans prensipal li lè li afime ke li te \"fò ak Hugo ak anbigwe ak Verlaine\" (\"kon Hugo fuerte y con Verlaine anbigwe\".)

Lè sa a, mwen di: \"Shakespeare! Dantè! Hugo...! (e nan tèt mwen: Verlaine...!) \" Lè sa a, lè li di orevwa: \"-Granmoun, li enpòtan pou di: madanm mwen soti nan peyi mwen an; metrès mwen soti nan Pari. \"  Los raros se yon volim ilistrasyon konsènan gou literè, ki li te pibliye nan menm ane a kòm Prosas profanas, ak dedye a yon ti tan glise kèk nan ekriven yo ak entèlektyèl yo nan direksyon pou ki li te santi gwo twou san fon admirasyon.

Almay Lwès te rantre nan NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik nan 1955, ki te mennen nan fòmasyon nan Pak la Warsaw rival pandan Lagè Fwad la. Trete Nò Atlantik la te lajman dors jiskaske lagè Koreyen an te inisye etablisman NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik la pou aplike li ak yon estrikti militè entegre. Sa a enkli fòmasyon nan Siprèm Katye Jeneral Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) nan 1951, ki adopte anpil nan estrikti militè Inyon Lwès la ak plan, ki gen ladan akò yo sou estandadize ekipman ak akò sou estasyon fòs militè etranje nan peyi Ewopeyen yo. An 1952, pòs Sekretè Jeneral NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik la te etabli kòm chèf sivil òganizasyon an. Ane sa a te wè tou premye gwo egzèsis maritim NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik la, Egzèsis Mainbrace ak adisyon Grès ak Latiki nan òganizasyon an. Aprè konferans Lond ak Paris yo, Almay Lwès te gen dwa pou li te revòme militèman, jan yo te rantre nan NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik nan mwa me 1955, ki te, nan vire, yon faktè enpòtan nan kreyasyon Pak Warsaw dominasyon Sovyetik la, deline de bò opoze nan Lagè Fwad la.  Konstriksyon miray Bèlen an 1961 te make yon wotè nan tansyon Gè Fwad la, lè 400,000 twoup US yo te estasyone nan Ewòp. Doub sou fòs nan relasyon ki genyen ant eta Ewopeyen yo ak Etazini yo ebbed ak koule, ansanm ak dout sou kredibilite nan defans lan NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik kont yon envazyon Sovyetik pwospè - dout ki te mennen nan devlopman nan endepandan franse fòs dekouraje nikleyè ak retrè a nan Lafrans soti nan estrikti NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik la nan militè nan 1966. An 1982, Espay ki te fèk vin demokratik te rantre nan alyans lan.  Revolisyon 1989 yo nan Ewòp te mennen nan yon re-evalyasyon estratejik nan objektif NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik la, nati, travay, ak konsantre sou kontinan an. Nan mwa Oktòb 1990, Almay Lès te vin yon pati nan Repiblik Federal Almay la ak alyans lan, ak nan Novanm 1990, alyans lan te siyen Trete a sou Fòs Lame konvansyonèl nan Ewòp (CFE) nan Pari ak Inyon Sovyetik. Li te mande rediksyon militè espesifik atravè kontinan an, ki te kontinye apre efondreman Pak Varswa a nan mwa fevriye 1991 ak disolisyon Inyon Sovyetik nan mwa desanm sa a, ki te retire de facto advèsè prensipal yo nan NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik la. Sa a te kòmanse yon rale desann nan depans militè ak ekipman nan Ewòp. Trete CFE a te pèmèt moun ki te siyen li yo retire 52 000 moso zam konvansyonèl nan 16 ane ki vin apre yo, e li te pèmèt depans militè pa manm Ewopeyen NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik yo diminye pa 28 pousan soti nan 1990 a 2015. Nan 1990 asirans yo te bay pa plizyè lidè Lwès yo Mikhail Gorbachev ke NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik pa ta elaji pi lwen bò solèy leve, jan yo revele pa memorandòm nan konvèsasyon prive. Sepandan, tèks final la nan Trete a sou Settlement final la ak respè nan Almay, ki te siyen pita nan ane sa a, pa te gen okenn mansyone pwoblèm nan nan ekspansyon bò solèy leve.  De seksyon konkrè wo nan yon miray nan yon gazon zèb devan yon bilding koube ak fenèt vè ble. Fall nan miray la Bèlen nan 1989 make yon pwen vire nan wòl NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik la nan Ewòp, ak seksyon sa a nan miray la se kounye a parèt deyò katye jeneral NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik la. Nan ane 1990 yo, òganizasyon an pwolonje aktivite li nan sitiyasyon politik ak imanitè ki pa t 'anvan te enkyetid NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik. Pandan kraze nan Yougoslavi, òganizasyon an te fè premye entèvansyon militè li yo nan Bosni soti nan 1992 a 1995 ak pita Yougoslavi an 1999. Konflik sa yo te motive yon gwo restrukturasyon militè apre Lagè Fwad la. Estrikti militè NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik la te redwi ak reòganize, ak nouvo fòs tankou Katye Jeneral Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps etabli.  Politikman, òganizasyon an te chèche pi bon relasyon ak eta yo nouvo otonòm santral ak lès Ewopeyen an, ak fowòm diplomatik pou koperasyon rejyonal ant NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik la ak vwazen li yo te etabli pandan peryòd sa a apre Lagè Fwad, ki gen ladan Patenarya pou lapè ak inisyativ dyalòg Mediterane a nan 1994, Konsèy la Euro-Atlantik Patenarya nan 1997, ak NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik la-Larisi Konsèy la Joint Pèmanan nan 1998. Nan somè 1999 Washington, Ongri, Polòy, ak Repiblik Tchekoslovaki ofisyèlman rantre nan NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik, ak òganizasyon an tou pibliye nouvo direktiv pou manm ak endividyalize \"Aksyon Plan Manm\". Plan sa yo gouvène adisyon ki vin apre a nan nouvo manm alyans. Eleksyon Prezidan franse Nicolas Sarkozy an 2007 te mennen nan yon gwo refòm nan pozisyon militè Lafrans la, ki te fini ak retou a manm plen sou 4 avril 2009, ki te gen ladan tou Lafrans retounen nan Estrikti Kòmandman Militè NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik la, pandan y ap kenbe yon dekouraje endepandan nikleyè.  Atik 5 nan Trete Nò Atlantik la, ki egzije eta manm yo vini nan èd nan nenpòt eta manm ki sijè a yon atak ame, te envoke pou premye ak sèlman fwa apre atak 11 septanm yo, apre yo fin ki twoup yo te deplwaye nan Afganistan anba NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik ki te dirije ISAF la. Òganizasyon an te opere yon seri de wòl adisyonèl depi lè sa a, ki gen ladan voye fòmatè nan Irak, ede nan operasyon kont-pirat, ak nan 2011 ranfòse yon zòn ki pa gen vòl sou Libi an akò ak Rezolisyon 1973 Konsèy Sekirite Nasyonzini an.  Annexion Larisi a nan Crimea mennen nan kondanasyon fò pa tout manm NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik, e li te youn nan sèt fwa ke Atik 4, ki mande pou konsiltasyon nan mitan manm NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik, te invoqué. Tan anvan yo enkli pandan lagè Irak la ak lagè sivil Siryen an. Nan somè Wales 2014 la, lidè yo nan eta manm NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik la ofisyèlman angaje pou la pwemye fwa pou depanse ekivalan a omwen de pousan nan pwodwi domestik brit yo sou defans pa 2024, ki te deja sèlman yon direktiv enfòmèl. Nan somè Warsaw 2016 la, peyi NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik yo te dakò sou kreyasyon prezans NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik ranfòse, ki te deplwaye kat gwoup batay miltinasyonal nan gwosè batayon nan Estoni, Letoni, Lityani, ak Polòy. Anvan ak pandan 2022 envazyon Ris nan Ikrèn, plizyè peyi NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik voye twoup tè, bato de gè ak avyon de gè ranfòse alyans la bò solèy leve, ak plizyè peyi ankò envoke Atik 4. Nan mwa mas 2022, lidè NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik yo te rankontre nan Brussels pou yon somè ekstraòdinè ki te enplike tou lidè Gwoup Sèt la ak Inyon Ewopeyen an. Eta manm NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik yo te dakò pou etabli kat gwoup batay adisyonèl nan Bilgari, Ongri, Woumani, ak Slovaki, ak eleman nan fòs repons NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik la te aktive la pou premye fwa nan istwa NATOganizasyon Trete Nò Atlantik la.
