{"model_name": "wenge-research/yayi-7b", "input": "Tulis sabuting karangan tentang apakah langkah-langkah kabijakan korona baik gasan masyarakat atau kada", "target": "Limbah hampir dua tahun pandemi COVID-19 wan panutupan lagi, banyak urang di saluruh Walanda makin gugup wan muak lawan palarangan. Manurut Rijksoverheid, 74,000 kasus dikonfirmasi di Belanda pada tanggal 28 Januari, lawan hanya sapuluh kasus ICU atawa kamatian nang bahubungan lawan korona (Infeksi- Kasus Konfirmasi, 2022). Hal ini mamicu pardebatan: apakah pamarintah harus tarus manjalani langkah-langkah nginih atau kada? Gasan merumusakan jawaban, urang harus pertama-tama memahami virus wan cara penyebarannya, lalu mempertimbangkan perdebatan dari perspektif politik, etika, sosial wan ekonomi. Kasus SARS-CoV-2 nang partama dilaporakan, nang manyababakan panyakit COVID-19, tajadi pas 31 Disimbir 2019 (\"Panyakit Coronavirus\", 2022), wan maulah reaksi rantai instabilitas politik di saluruh dunia. Apa nang pamulaan dimulai sabagai wabah di Cina sudah mancapai hampir satiap nagara di dunia dalam hitungan bulan. Dalam 20 tahun tarakhir, banyak nagara nang talah dipangaruh ulih virus nang bahubungan lawan Covid-19 kaya SARS. Karena pengalaman sebelumnya, buhannya langsung maambil langkah nang pas. Misalnya, Cina kada baisi labih dari 110,000 kasus sajak pandemik dimulai, walaupun populasinya parak 1.5 miliar (Worldometer, 2022). Namun, nagara nang kurang stabil sacara politis, kaya Turki, kurang siap wan menderita dari 12 juta kasus, walaupun populasinya 85 juta. Virus ini manyabar hancap banar karna mekanisme transmisi nang ditampaiakan lewat udara. Amun ada nang parak lawan urang nang bajangkit, napas nang dikaluarakan ulih urang nang bajangkit tu kawa mambawa virus wan kawa dihirup ulih urang nang sehat. Mamakai topeng wan manjaga jarak manulungi urang-urang nang terinfeksi dari manyebarakan partikel virus ka parak urang nang sehat. Namun, di negara-negara di mana langkah-langkah kada ditegakkan, ada paningkatan nang ganal dalam kamatian nang talalu banyak. Varian omikron hanyar mambukti akan menyebar paling kada 20 kali labih hancap daripada strain asli karena 30 mutasinya (Grossman wan Stahel, 2022). Untungnya, itu jua jauh kada mematikan karena kada menyerang jaringan paru-paru pada tahap awal (Zimmer dan Ghorayshi, 2021). Urang jua kawa menganalisis batasan virus corona dari perspektif etika: apakah kita harus mengurangi langkah-langkah corona walaupun hal itu kawa membahayakan lebih banyak nyawa? Pas 28 Januari 2021, virus corona baisi tingkat kamatian 0.51%. Ngini relatif tinggi dibandingakan lawan virus respirasi nang lain kaya influenza, nang baisi tingkat mortalitas 0,01%. COVID-19 sacara kada proporsional mampangaruhi kalompok nang rentan, nang kaya urang-urang nang baisi kondisi kasihatan nang dasar kaya diabetes, obesitas, atawa panyakit otoimun. Hal ngini tarutama tajadi pada urang tuha, lantaran paningkatan jumlah kondisi kasihatan wan jua sistem imun nang marendahkan lawan usia. Coronavirus manjangkiti saluran pernapasan atas, tamasuk paru-paru. Inya masuk ka dalam sel-sel wan mamarintah buhannya gasan maulah salinan virus. Sel itu lalu tabuka wan mangirim salinan virus nang hanyar ka sel-sel lain. Akhirnya, amun kada ada respon imun nang efektif, pasien akan mati karena kerusakan paru-paru, tarutama lawan strain COVID-19 sabalum varian Omicron. Salawas lockdown, ada kontak manusia nang minimal, nang malambatakan penyebaran virus. Namun, mencegah kontak sosial baisi efek buruknya surang. Misalnya, selama lockdown ada labih dari 2.5 juta kakanakan nang berisiko tertinggal dalam pembelajaran (<unk>Jongeren<unk> 2021') (\"Education and COVID-19\", 2022). Salain itu, manurut OSF Healthcare, \"Rata-rata kunjungan mingguan ka jurusan darurat gasan dugaan usaha bunuh diri di antara gadis-gadis anum maningkat labih dari 50% dari periode nang sama tahun lalu\" (OSF Health Care, 2021). Jadi, maskipun banyak nyawa nang jadi taruhannya, dengan maambil langkah tambahan gasan urang-urang dalam kalompok risiko, urang kawa aman mambuka kembali masyarakat wan mencegah bunuh diri wan gangguan belajar di kalangan pamuda. Salain itu, vaksin kawa mancagah karusakan nang ganal ka jaringan dari tajadi. Dari perspektif sosial, coronavirus hudah terbukti menjadi \"masalah perpecahan\", mendorong beberapa urang gasan menyangkal vaksinasi. Banyak warga nang kada mau divaksin tanpa paham konsekuensinya. Ada dua jenis vaksin: mRNA wan vektor virus. Vaksin mRNA COVID-19 adalah vaksin mRNA pertama nang dipakai di masyarakat umum. Vaksin mRNA baisi RNA di dalam lipid nang mambantu RNA masuk ka dalam sel. Ribosom mambaca RNA wan mamarintah sel gasan maulah protein paku nang sama kaya SARS-CoV-2. Tubuh lalu mangaku bahwa protein Corona spike adalah panyusup wan maulah antibodi gasan mahancurakan buhannya. Sabagai perbandingan, vaksin vektor virus mamasukakan salinan virus nang kada berbahaya lawan DNA protein paku nang sama, mamicu sistim imun gasan manyarang wan maingatnya. Gasan kadua janis vaksin, sel B nang baingat akan tarus maulah antibodi amun urang kena virus asli di masa nang akan datang. Manurut Dr. Stahel, <unk>Omicron hudah banyak bermutasi sahingga baisi afinitas nang kurang dalam hal antibodi matan vaksin nang mangenalinya, jadi, oleh karena itu, jawabannya adalah suntikan booster, karena kamu akan melemahkan virus lawan jumlah respons imun walaupun kada ada patandingan nang sempurna<unk> (Grossman dan Stahel, 2022). Jadi, dosis vaksin asli wan, hanyar-hanyar ini, suntikan booster bamain peran penting dalam mancagah infeksi, tapi nang labih penting dalam mangurangi kamungkinan panyakit parah wan kamatian. Namun, studi hanyar manunjukakan bahwa kakebalan nang efektif kawa hilang dalam waktu anam bulan, maulah parlu gasan mandapat dosis tahunan, nang mirip lawan influenza (Doucleff). 13,6% populasi labih dari 18 tahun kada handak divaksinasi, utamanya karena kada parcaya lawan pamarintah (Vaccinations COVID-19 vaccinations, 2022). Hal ngini mabatasakan efek imunitas kawanan, sabuah konsep di mana amun cukup urang divaksinasi virus kada kawa lagi manyabar karena sabarataan sasarannya kebal. Akhirnya, urang harus mempertimbangkan implikasi ekonomi dari penutupan. Lockdown manyababakan pangangguran nang ganal, tarutama gasan urang-urang nang bagawi di industri parjalanan. Misalnya, menurut forum ekonomi dunia, 114 juta urang kehilangan gawian pada tahun 2020 (Richter, 2021). Salain itu, panutupan di saluruah dunia manyababkan sakitar 3,2 triliun euro karugian dalam pandapatan pakarajoan. Bahkan lawan dampak ekonomi nang dahsyat, urang harus mempertimbangkan fakta bahwa nyawa dipertaruhkan bila langkah-langkah corona nang tepat kada diambil. Menurut NPR, ada kira-kira 488 kali jumlah kasus di Cina amun langkah-langkah nang kada memadai diambil, jadi menyelamatkan jutaan nyawa (Beaubien, 2020). Kesimpulannya, dengan mempertimbangkan COVID-19 dari lensa politik, etis, sosial dan ekonomi, aku menyimpulkan bahwa walaupun virus ini sangat menular dan mematikan kelompok tertentu, penguncian hanyalah solusi sementara. Penutupan hanya menguntungkan gasan masyarakat kita pas tingkat kematian nang berlebihan mulai meningkat. Makanya, lawan maambil langkah-langkah dari awal, nagara-nagara kawa maambatakan panyebaran virus. Misalnya, parlu anam bulan sabalum mamakai topeng dilihat sabagai langkah nang layak. Nang kaya talihat dalam panutupan partama, puluhan ribu urang kahilangan gawian wan labih matan 2.5 juta kakanakan harus balajar jarak jauh di Walanda (\"Jongeren\", 2021). Jadi, lawan malakukan langkah-langkah pas waktunya wan siap-siap, sasaurang kada parlu ma-lockdown. Namun, amun kamatian mulai manjadi talalu banyak, parlu manegakkan langkah-langkah korona nang sasuai.", "output": " mereka are already affected by the measures taken by the government to contain the virus."}

Iwak listrik lagi dilapurakan ribuan tahun imbahnya oleh naturalis Yunani, Romawi wan Arab kuno wan dokter. Babarapa panulis bahari, nang kaya Pliny the Elder wan Scribonius Largus, mambuktiakan pangaruh nang mambungkam matan guncangan listrik nang dikirimakan ulih ikan lele listrik wan sinar listrik, wan tahu bahwa guncangan kaya itu kawa bajalan di sapanjang objek nang manganduang. Pasien nang sakit kaya asam urat atawa sakit kapala disuruh manyentuh iwak listrik dalam harapan bahwa guncangan nang kuat bisa manambal buhannya. Budaya kuno di sekitar Mediterania tahu bahwa benda-benda tertentu, kaya batang amber, kawa diusap lawan bulu kucing gasan manarik benda-benda ringan kaya bulu. Thales dari Miletus meulah serangkaian pengamatan pada listrik statis sekitar 600 SM, dari mana inya percaya bahwa gesekan meulah amber jadi magnetik, berbeda lawan mineral nang kaya magnetit, nang kada parlu digosok. Thales salah dalam parcaya bahwa tarikan tu disebabkan oleh efek magnetik, tapi ilmu pengetahuan imbahnya mambuktiakan hubungan antara magnetisme wan listrik. Manurut teori nang kontroversial, urang Parthia mungkin baisi pengetahuan tentang galvanis, badasarakan panamuan tahun 1936 dari Baterai Baghdad, nang mirip lawan sel galvanik, walaupun kada yakin apakah artefak itu bersifat listrik. Listrik akan tatap labih dari sabuting keingintahuan intelektual salawas ribuan tahun sampai tahun 1600, pas ilmuwan Inggris William Gilbert manulis De Magnete, di mana inya maulah studi nang cermat tentang listrik wan magnetisme, mambedaakan efek lodestone dari listrik statis nang dihasilakan lawan menggosok amber. Inya manciptaakan kata Latin hanyar electricus (\"dari amber\" atawa \"kaya amber\", elektron, kata Yunani gasan \"amber\") gasan marujuk pada sifat manarik benda-benda halus imbah diusap. Asosiasi ini meulah kata-kata bahasa Inggris \"listrik\" wan \"listrik\", nang pertama kali muncul di buku Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica tahun 1646. Gawian labih lanjut digawi pas abad ka-17 wan pamulaan abad ka-18 ulih Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray wan C. F. du Fay. Pado akhia abaik ka-18, Benjamin Franklin mangarajoan panalitian nan ekstensif dalam bidang listrik, manjuwa barang-barang asanyo untuak mangadanai karyanyo. Pada bulan Juni 1752 inya dikatahui sudah manempelakan kunci logam di bagian bawah tali layang-layang nang basah wan malayangkan layang-layangnya di langit nang diancam badai.

Inya jua manjalasakan parilaku paradoksal jar Leyden sabagai alat gasan manyimpan banyak muatan listrik dalam hal listrik nang tadiri dari muatan positif wan negatif Pada tahun 1775, Hugh Williamson melaporkan serangkaian percobaan ke Royal Society pada guncangan yang dikirimkan oleh belut listrik; pada tahun nang sama ahli bedah dan ahli anatomi John Hunter menggambarkan struktur organ listrik ikan. Pada tahun 1791, Luigi Galvani manarbitakan panamuan bioelektromagnetiknya, manunjukakan bahwa listrik adalah media nang mana neuron mamindahakan sinyal ka otot. Baterai atawa tumpukan voltaik Alessandro Volta tahun 1800, nang diulah matan lapisan seng wan tembaga nang bagantian, mambari buhan ilmuwan sumber energi listrik nang labih tapandiri daripada mesin elektrostatik nang digunakan sabalumnya. Pengakuan elektromagnetisme, kesatuan fenomena listrik wan magnetik, dikarenakan oleh Hans Christian Ørsted wan André-Marie Ampère pada tahun 1819-1820. Michael Faraday manamuakan motor listrik pada tahun 1821, wan Georg Ohm sacara matematis menganalisis sirkuit listrik pada tahun 1827. Listrik wan magnetisme (wan cahaya) sacara pasti dihubungakan ulih James Clerk Maxwell, khususnya dalam \"On Physical Lines of Force\" tahun 1861 wan 1862. Sementara awal abad ke-19 telah melihat kemajuan pesat dalam ilmu listrik, akhir abad ke-19 akan melihat kemajuan terbesar dalam teknik listrik. Melalui urang-urang nang kaya Alexander Graham Bell, Otto Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla wan George Westinghouse, listrik beubah dari keingintahuan ilmiah menjadi alat penting gasan kehidupan modern. Pada tahun 1887, Heinrich Hertz manamuakan bahwa elektroda nang dipancahakan lawan sinar ultraviolet maulah kilauan listrik labih mudah. Pada tahun 1905, Albert Einstein mempublikasikan makalah nang menjelaskan data eksperimental dari efek fotoelektrik sebagai hasil dari energi cahaya nang dibawa dalam paket kuantis diskrit, menggerakkan elektron. Penemuan ini meulah revolusi kuantum. Einstein dianugerahi Hadiah Nobel dalam Fisika pada tahun 1921 gasan \"penemuannya atas hukum efek fotoelektrik\". Efek fotoelektrik jua dipakai dalam sel-sel cahaya nang kaya nang ditamui di panel surya. \"Detektor kumis kucing\" adalah alat nang pertama kali dipakai pas tahun 1900-an dalam penerima radio.
