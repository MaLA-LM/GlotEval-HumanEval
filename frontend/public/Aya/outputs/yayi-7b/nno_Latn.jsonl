Ved å bruka ein annan hop i oppskriften din, anten frå den same hopfamilien eller frå ei heilt anna hopfamilie, kan du lett gjera interessante og ofte radikale endringar i smaksprofilen til øllet ditt.

Bruka ei anna gjær I tillegg til at dei fermenterer øl, kan gjær etterlate seg mange interessante smaker og kan gje det heimebrygget ditt sin eigen subtile karakter. Til dømes kan engelske gjær-stammar gje malt- og søt smak, California-gjær har ein tendens til å skapa eit reint og sprett øl, medan sesonggjær gir skinnende og fruktig smak til øllet ditt.  3.

The poem, which was published in 1893, describes a farmer who is contemplating the beauty of a field of wheat, but his words suggest that the beauty is not as he thinks. The irony in Frost's poem is that the farmer is so fond of the wheat that he believes it to be a beautiful thing, yet the poem suggests that the wheat is not as he thinks it is. The poem's irony is intended to make the reader think critically about the beauty of the natural world and the ways in which we may interpret it.

The for loop is a common language construct that allows a variable to be iterated through a sequence of elements. It is used to repeat a block of code as many times as there are elements in the sequence. It is typically used to perform a specific task on each element in a sequence. Here is an example of a for loop: for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { System.out.println(i); } This code block will print 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The variable i is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop. It is important to note that the loop will not break until the variable i reaches 10. For more complex situations, the loop can be used to iterate through a list of elements or even a larger sequence of elements. For example: for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { System.out.println(i); } This code block will print 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. The variable i is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.

Vil du ha ein tradisjonell forbrenningsmotor, eller vil du ha ein elektrisk? Om du velgar forbrenningsmotor, kor mange sylindrar brukar du då?

Kvar frå vegen? Å kjøre bil? - Assistansesystem: Moderne motorsyklar har ei rekkje assistansesystem som ABS, fartskontroll, avstandssensorer, elektroniske føringsmodus for ulike værforhold etc. Dei kan gjera føring tryggare, men dei legg òg til vekt og gjer sykkelen dyrare.

Båe har stor innverknad på kor godt du har kontroll når du ikkje er i kø, til dømes når du treng å stoppa ved eit trafikklys eller når du må gå langsomt i stopp-og-gå-trafikk.

Kommunistiske styresmakter blei innsette i dei austlege statane. Etter å ha vorte den andre kjernefysiske makta i verda, etablerte Sovjetunionen alliansen Warszawapakta, og gjekk inn i ei kamp for global dominans, kjent som Den kalde krigen, med rivalane USA og NATO. Etter Stalins død i 1953 og ei kort periode med kollektiv styre, fordømde den nye leiaren Nikita Khrusjtsjov Stalin og starta ei politikk for avstalinisering, og lét mange politiske fangar frå Gulag-arbeidsleirane fri. Den generelle avlastinga av repressive politikkar blei seinare kjend som Khrusjtsjov Thaw. Samstundes nådde spenningane i den kalde krigen eit høgepunkt då dei to rivalane krangla om utplasseringa av amerikanske Jupiter-rakettar i Tyrkia og sovjetiske rakettar på Cuba.  I 1957 sende Sovjetunionen ut den første kunstige satelliten i verda, Sputnik 1, og på den måten starta romrommet. Den russiske kosmonauten Jurij Gagarin blei den første menneske som kom i bane rundt jorda, om bord på det bemanna romfartøyet Vostok 1 den 12. april 1961. Etter at Khrusjtsjov blei avsett i 1964 følgde det ei anna periode med kollektiv styre, til Leonid Bresjnev blei leiar. På 1970-talet og tidleg på 1980-talet blei det kalla stagnasjonstida. Kosygin-reformen i 1965 hadde som mål å desentralisere den sovjetiske økonomien delvis. I 1979, etter ein kommunistisk revolusjon i Afghanistan, invaderte sovjetiske styrkar landet, og det førte til ein sovjetisk-afghansk krig. I mai 1988 byrja Sovjetunionen å trekkja seg ut av Afghanistan, på grunn av internasjonal motstand, vedvarende antisovjetisk geriljakrig og mangel på støtte frå sovjetiske borgarar.  Frå 1985 og utover, den siste sovjetiske leiaren Mikhail Gorbatsjov, som søkte å innføra liberale reformer i det sovjetiske systemet, innførde politikken glasnost (opening) og perestrojka (omstrukturering) i eit forsøk på å ende perioden med økonomisk stagnasjon og å demokratisere styresmaktene. Dette førte til framveksten av sterke nasjonalistiske og separatistiske rørsler over heile landet. Før 1991 var Sovjetunionen den nest største økonomien i verda, men i dei siste åra av styresmakten gjekk det inn i ei krise.  I 1991 byrja den økonomiske og politiske uroen å koma over seg då dei baltiske statane valde å trekkja seg frå Sovjetunionen. Den 17. mars blei det halde ein folkeavstemning der det store flertalet av dei deltakande borgarane stemde for å endra Sovjetunionen til ein fornyet føderasjon. I juni 1991 blei Boris Jeltsin den første direkte valde presidenten i russisk historie då han blei vald til president i den russiske SFSR. I august 1991 førte eit kuppforsøk frå medlemmar av Gorbatsjovs regjering, rettet mot Gorbatsjov og med sikte på å verna Sovjetunionen, til slutten på Kommunistpartiet i Sovjetunionen.

Eg har tenkt mykje over det og gjort ein del undersøkingar kring det. Eg veit at det er ein stor forplikting å ha eit kjæledyr, så eg skriv til deg for å fortelje deg kvifor eg trur du burde kjøpa meg eit kjæledyr, og kvifor eit kjæledyr er eit fantastisk val.  Å ta vare på eit kjæledyrskildpadde vil gje meg ei sterk ansvarsfølelse. Eg veit at eg må sørge for at skilpadda mi har nok mat, og at ho får rett temperatur, og at ho har høve til å sola seg under ein varm lampe eller i sola, om det er varmt nok. Eg er villig til å gje tid og engasjement til å ta vare på skildpadda mi. Eg vil ha ansvar for skildpadda, og eg vil ta vare på han.  Som du veit, lider eg av angst og skulen gjer meg særleg uroleg av og til. Det har vorte vist gjennom mange undersøkingar at kjæledyr reduserer angst og stress hos menneske. Eg er sikker på at det å ha ei skildpadde vil vera ein fantastisk avleiing frå bekymringane mine og gje meg stor glede. I motsetnad til det mange trur, elskar skildpadder at du tek vare på dei og kjellar dei. Eg trur det er veldig avslappande å strøke med ein skildpadde når eg kjem heim frå skulen.  Skilpadder er svært sjølvstendig. Forutsett at dei får ein varm plass å sola seg i, tilgang til ferskt vatn og mykje frisk mat som rotløk, grønkål, salat og andre bladgrønnsaker, er dei svært glade i å bli attlade. Sidan vi bur i Storbritannia der temperaturen kan vera kald, må vi kjøpe eit skildpaddagbord med godt underlag, ein sollampe og skinn der skildpadda kan krype seg unna. Vi har mykje plass til dette i kjøkkenet vårt. Når det er varmt, kan skildpadda gå inn i hagen vår i ein gjerde. Ein sköldpaddestol og ein lampe koster rundt 200 pund, men dette er berre den første utgåva. Etter det er det veldig billeg å ha ei skildpadde. Faktisk, kan du plukke ut mesteparten av maten deira for gratis når du kjem inn på ein matboks, som eg gjerne vil gjere når eg går på tur med familien.  I motsetnad til det mange trur, kan skilpadder vera veldig venlege. Som eg sa før, elskar dei å bli strøke, men veit du at dei kjenner eigarane sine og at nokre av dei til og med svarar på namn? Faktisk, ei studie viste at skildpadder kan identifisera sine fyrste eigarar som dei ikkje har sett på mange år, så dei er både venlege og svært intelligente. Kanskje du lurer på om det er vrøvl med skilpadde, men eg har gjort mykje forsking på dette, og no veit eg nøyaktig kva eg skal gjera. Om vi kjøper ei skildpadde, må den dvelja i tre månader frå slutten av september. Vi må la skilpadda ligga i ein kar som er godt isolera. Temperaturen må ikkje gå over eller under 5 grader celsius, og garasjen vår er perfekt for dette. Vi har ein temperaturmålar der inne så eg kan sjå på varmen.  Til slutt har eg sett på kostnaden for å kjøpa ei skildpadde. Eg foreslår at vi kjøper ei sköldpadd som er eit par år gammal, sidan dei treng mindre omsorg. Vi kunne kjøpt eit stykke av den forgjengelege papegøya vår, som hadde ein microchip på, for 100 pund. Og når me går på ferie, har eg funne eit Turtle-hotell som er styrt av ein veterinær og kostar 60 pund per person for 10 dagar.  Eg trur de er samde i at eg har gjort ein svært grundig forsking på å ta vare på ein skildpadde og eg vonar de er samde i at eg no er moden nok til å ta vare på eit kjæledyr. Eg trur verkeleg at eit kjæledyr med skilpadde vil gje meg ei sterk ansvarsfølelse og ha ei positiv, beroleggjørende effekt på humøret mitt. Eg trur heile familien vil like å ha ei skildpadde. Dei er venlege, kjærlege, interessante og intelligente dyr, og vi vil alle ha nytte av å ha dei.  Eg ville vore takknemlig om du ville gi mitt ønske full omsyn.  Eg elskar deg så mykje.

{"model_name": "wenge-research/yayi-7b", "input": "Skriv ein essay om om corona-politikk er til nytte for samfunnet eller ikkje", "target": "Etter nesten to år med COVID-19-pandemi og enda ein lockdown, er mange i Nederland blitt urolege og har fått nok av avgrensingane. Ifølgje Rijksoverheid blei det konfirmert rekordhøge 74.000 tilfelle i Nederland den 28. januar, med berre ti corona-relaterte ICU-innleggingar eller dødsfall (<unk>Infeksjonar-Konfirmerte tilfelle<unk>, 2022). Dette veker debatten: bør regjeringa fortsette å gjennomføra desse tiltagene eller ikkje? For å formulera eit svar, må ein først forstå viruset og korleis det sprei seg, og deretter sjå på debatta frå politisk, etisk, sosial og økonomisk perspektiv. Det fyrste tilfellet med SARS-CoV-2, som er årsaken til COVID-19, vart rapportert den 31. desember 2019 (\"Coronavirus-sykdom\", 2022), og det sette i gang ei kjedereaksjon av politisk ustabilitet over heile verda. Det som først starta som ein epidemi i Kina, nådde nesten heile verda på få månader. På dei siste 20 åra har mange land blitt påverka av virus relaterte til Covid-19 som SARS. På grunn av den tidlege erfaringa tok dei med ein gong til rette tiltak. Til dømes har Kina ikkje hatt meir enn 110,000 tilfelle sidan pandemiken byrja, sjølv om landet har nesten 1,5 milliardar innbyggjarar (Worldometer, 2022). Men eit land med dårleg politisk stabilitet, som Tyrkia, var dårleg forberedt og led av 12 millionar tilfelle, til trass for at landet har ein befolkning på 85 millionar. Viruset sprei seg veldig raskt på grunn av den luftbårne overføringsmekanismen. Om ein er i nærleiken av ein infisert person, kan utåndinga til den som er smitta ha viruset og kan inhalerast av friske individ. Masker og avstand hjelper til med å hindre at smitta menneske kan spreia viruspartiklar i nærleiken til friske menneske. I land der det ikkje blei gjennomført tiltak, var det likevel ein stor auke i overdrevande dødsfall. Den nye omikronvarianten viser seg å spreia seg minst 20 gonger raskare enn den opphavlege stammen på grunn av dei 30 mutasjonane (Grossman og Stahel, 2022). Heldigvis er det òg langt mindre dødeleg fordi det ikkje angriper lungvev i dei tidlegare stadia sine (Zimmer og Ghorayshi, 2021). Ein kan òg analysera koronavirus-restriktingar frå eit etisk perspektiv: Skal vi senka koronastrengingane sjølv om det kan sette fleire liv i fare? Frå og med 28. januar 2021 hadde koronaviruset ein dødelighet på 0,51%. Dette er relativt høgt samanlikna med andre respiratoriske virus som influensa, som har ein dødelighet på 0,01%. COVID-19 har uforholdsmessig stor innverknad på sårbare grupper, slik som dei med underliggende helsemessige tilstandar som diabetes, overvekt eller autoimmune sjukdomar. Dette er særleg sant hos eldre, på grunn av den auka mengden helseproblem og det immunforsvaret som forverrar seg med å elda seg. Koronaviruset smittar den øvre luftveggen, inkludert lungane. Det bryter inn i celler og får dei til å lage kopiar av viruset. Cellen spreng opp og sender nye kopiar av viruset til andre celler. Til slutt, om det ikkje er eit effektivt immunsvar, vil pasienten døy på grunn av lungeskade, særleg med COVID-19-stammar før Omicron-varianten. Under ein lockdown, er det minimal menneskeleg kontakt, som bremser spreiding av viruset. Men å avverge sosial kontakt har sine eigne ødeleggande konsekvensar. Til dømes var det i løpet av lockdown over 2,5 millionar born som var i fare for å koma bak i læringa (<unk>Jongeren<unk> 2021') (\"Education and COVID-19\", 2022). Vidare, ifølgje OSF Healthcare, \"Gjennomsnittslege ukentlege besøk til akutt avdeling for mistanke om sjølvmordstrykk blant unge jenter var opp over 50% frå same periode for eit år sidan\" (OSF Health Care, 2021). Sjølv om fleire liv er på spel, kan ein trygt opna samfunnet og forebygge sjølvmord og læringsskader hos ungdomar, ved å ta til ekstra tiltak for dei i risikogruppa. Dessutan kan vaksine hindra større skade på vev frå å skje i første omgang. Frå eit samfunnsperspektiv har korona vist seg å vera eit \"splinterproblem\" som driv nokre til å nekta å ta vaksine. Mange borgarar held seg frå å få vaksine utan å verkeleg forstå konsekvensane. Det finst to typar vaksine: mRNA og virusvektor. mRNA-vaksina mot COVID-19 var den første mRNA-vaksina som blei brukt i allmennheten. mRNA-vaksina har RNA inne i lipidar som hjelper RNA til å koma inn i cellen. Ribosoma les RNA og instruksjonerer cellane til å laga dei same spike-proteinane som SARS-CoV-2. Kroppen kjenner då til at Corona-spike-proteinane er inntrengarar og skaper antistopar for å øydeleggje dei. Til sammenligning legg virusvektor-vaksine inn ein harmlaus kopi av viruset med det same DNA-proteinet, noko som gjer at immunsystemet angriper og minnest det. For begge typar vaksine, vil minne B-celler fortsette å produsere antistopar i tilfelle personen blir eksponert for det reelle viruset i framtida. I samsvar med Dr. Stahel, har <unk>Omicron mutert så mykje at det har mindre affinitet i termer av antistopar frå vaksinen som gjenkjenner det, så svaret er booster-skote, fordi du vil overvelda viruset med mengden av immunresponsen sjølv om det ikkje finst ein perfekt match<unk> (Grossman og Stahel, 2022). Såleis spelar den originale vaksindosen og, seinare, booster-dosen ein viktig rolle i å forebygge infeksjonar, men viktigare i å redusere sjansen for alvorleg sjukdom og død. Nye undersøkingar har likevel vist at effektiv immunitet kan forsvinna innan seks månader, og det er difor naudsynt å få årlege dosar, liknande influensa (Doucleff). 13,6% av folkesetnaden over 18 år nektar å vaksinerast, hovudsakleg på grunn av mistillit til regjeringa (Vaccinations COVID-19 vaccinations, 2022). Dette begrensar effektane av flokksimmunitet, eit konsept der viruset ikkje lenger kan spreia seg om nok folk blir vaksinert fordi alle målene er immune. Til slutt må ein tenkja på dei økonomiske konsekvensane av ein lockdown. Lockdown førte til kolossal arbeidsledighet, særleg for dei som arbeidde i reisebransjen. Til dømes, ifølgje World Economic Forum, mista 114 millionar menneske jobben sine i løpet av 2020 (Richter, 2021). I tillegg førte lockdownane til ein tap på 3,2 billionar euro i inntekter frå arbeid. Sjølv med dei øydeleggjande økonomiske konsekvensane, må ein tenkja på det faktum at menneskeliv blir sett på spel når egne koronaspørsmål ikkje vert sett i verk. Ifølgje NPR ville det ha vore omtrent 488 gonger så mange tilfelle i Kina om det ikkje blei teke tilstrekkelege tiltak, og dermed spart millionar av liv (Beaubien, 2020). Til slutt, ved å sjå på COVID-19 frå eit politisk, etisk, sosialt og økonomisk synspunkt, konkluderer eg med at sjølv om viruset er svært smittsamt og dødeleg mot visse grupper, er stengjingar berre ei midlertidig løysing. Ein sperring er berre nyttig for samfunnet vårt når det tek til å auka dødelegheita. Ved å ta tiltag tidlegare kan land begrensa spredinga av viruset. Det tok til dømes seks månader før masker blei sett på som eit mogleg tiltak. Som i den første innestenginga, tapte titusentals menneske jobben sine og over 2,5 millionar born måtte gjera fjernlæring i Nederland (\"Jongeren\", 2021). Så ved å ta tiltak i tide og vera forberedt, treng ein ikkje å gå inn i låsing. Men om dødstalen byrjar å bli overdreven, er det verdt å gjennomføra ein proporsjonell mengd av koronaspørsmål.", "output": ".

Pengane går til utstyr og kakaobønner. Til utstyr treng du ein melanger (om lag 600 dollar) for å mala bønner og ein tempermaskin (om lag 400 dollar) for å laga det ferdige produktet. Du treng òg ein silikonmatte (om lag 20 dollar) og ein hårtørkar (om lag 30 dollar). Men lat oss starte med opphavet.  Kjøp mellom to og seks pund av fermenterte råa kakaobønner. Det finst mange ulike importørar på nettet. Velg ein sjokoladevariant eller ein blanding som passar deg.  Sortar bønne, fjernar brote bønner, dårleg misforma bønner, og kva som helst framande kroppar som kan vera til stede.  Ryst beina, to pund om gongen, ved 350 F i mellom 20 og 30 minutt, avhengig av kva du har opplevd med beina eller av lukta dei har. Dei luktar som ferske brød. Brenn dei ikkje!  Lat bønnane kølna.  Skjel bøna. Du kan gjera dette for hand - som eg fann produserer eit overlegent produkt - men du skal vite at dette kan ta opptil 6 timar per kilo. Alternativt kan du kjøpa ein vinbryter og bruka hårføner til å blåsa ut skjelene. Denne tilnærminga er mykje raskare, men lèt meir hud og taper meir bønnfragment. Uansett, tenk på den siste frøen du la ut.  La meg freiste ei stund til. Bruka hårtørkaren til å få mølleoverflatene opp til minst 120F. Legg ein handfull bønner til av gong. Hjelp med å flytta på melanger om han vert sitjande. Sjå til at melangeren går jevnt før du lèt han vera utan tilsyn. Når det vert satt i gang, kjem det til å gå bra.  Lat den bli til i 24 til 72 timar, avhengig av kva du har opplevd med bønne og smak. Om du prøver ein blanding av bønner, legg til dei sterkare aromaterte bønne tidleg i prosessen og dei delikatare aromaterte bønne seinare. Til og med dei mest delikate bønnane må du gje dei minst åtte timar. Legg sukker etter smak. Den vektprocenten sukker kan variera frå nokre få prosent opp til 30 prosent. Du kan smelte det med mjølk og andre smakstiltøy. Vaniljebonar, for eksempel. Blanda sukker og andre tilsetningsstoff minst 8 timar til. Målet er å redusere storleiken av partiklar til mindre enn det som kan oppfattast med tunga. Når du er ferdig, kan du drikka det i ein silikonpann. Dette er den uklare sjokoladen din. Ho smelt lett og vert brukkjelande når ho blir eldre. Det er difor du gjer det.  Til slutt følg instruksjonane på tempereringsmaskina og legg til stykk av sjokolade som ikkje er temperert. Den flytande tempererte sjokoladen kan brukast til å dyppa frukt eller hella inn i former for barer eller formete godteri. Andre tilsetningar kan leggjast til på dette stadiet - nøtter, nougat osv.

Ein tirsdagsmorgon, medan ho venta på bussen, såg ho eit ljoset objekt på gata. Ho bøygde seg ned for å henta på han, og han glimte i sola. Ho hadde aldri sett ein så strålande skatt, fargen på ein regnboge, og når ho så nærare på ho, likna ho utruleg mykje på ei drageliknande skjel, men ho kunne ikkje tru at ho verkeleg var ei drageliknande skjel fordi ho såg berre ut som ein historiefortellar. Ho såg seg omkring og såg ein annan skinnande skala, som eit spor av brødsmørk som førte henne til skogen bak huset. Ho visste at foreldra hennar ville at ho skulle gå på skule, men nysgjerrigheita hennar fekk overtaket, og ho byrja å følgja sporet etter skinnende skjel til skogen. Ho kjempa seg gjennom skogen til ho kom over noko som såg ut som ei hule som ho var sikker på ikkje var der før. Ho forvarsamt gjekk inn i grotta, og i staden for at grotta vart mørkare, vart ho klarare og klarare, Då ho gjekk rundt hjørnet i hulen, såg ho den vakreste skinande draken og kunne ikkje tru augo sine! Langsomt kravla ho mot draken, som såg nøye på ho då ho nærma seg. Ho heldt ut handa som om ho ville klappa draken, og draken lukta på handa hennar, og deretter rive han hovudet av ho på handa hennar for å signalisere at han ville bli ven med ho. Ho fnissa medan draken mølla og gnubba den skinnande kroppen hans rundt henne. Då tala draken og spurde ho om ho nokon gong hadde vore i dei andre verdene. Ho ristet på hovudet, draken blinkte, og la fram ein bilete på veggen i holene, for å visa ein av dei flotte verdane utanfor, som var fulle av dragar. Ho spurde om dragen ville ta henne dit, og dragen la og niva, og signala til ho at ho skulle hoppa på han. Ho vart so opprømt, at ho hoppa på draken igjen. Ho heldt på, og medan dragen gjekk ut av grotta, opna portalen for han å hoppa inn i. Ho lukka augo og visste ikkje kva som skulle skje neste gong. Ho opna endeleg augo og såg forundra ut.

{"model_name": "wenge-research/yayi-7b", "input": "Kvifor skulle folk trilla ut urtar og hagar til lokale planter?", "target": "Kven elskar ikkje sommerfuglar? Dei er eit vakkert symbol på uskyld. Men har du lagt merke til at det er færre og færre kvar år? Då eg var liten kunne du ikkje reise utan å få nokre sommerfuglar på forrutan på bilen din. Så kvifor er det så få, og kva tyder det?  Ein av dei viktigaste grunnane er bruken av plantevernmidler og herbicidar. Desse kjemikaliane kan ta livet av ein. Og dei går over alt dette og skadar i heile ekosystemet. På mitt gard har eg sett kor mykje tolmod gjer at ting kjem tilbake i balanse. Eg hadde eit søkk eller ei røykjesild, men det funkar ikkje. Eg hadde moskar på grunn av kyllinghallen min, men over eit par veker såg eg svelgar og phoebar flytta inn og utnytta fødekjelda.  Den andre grunnen til at me ser færre sommerfuglar er at dei er mat for toalettar. Dei fleste sommerfuglar og motar (eller nattsmørfuglar som eg liker å kalla dei) treng ei særskild plante som vert vert vert vert for larvene sine. For monarkfjellene er det mjølkgress (Asclepias), som er eit uheldig namn for ei vakker plante. For Pipevine Swallowtails er det Pipevine (Aristolochia). Utan desse plantane har larvar ikkje matkjelder. Og ettersom byar og forstæder blir asfaltert, er det ikkje meir rom for desse planteane som var rike på det. Når vi ser på gardene våre, har dei vakre planter som er importerte frå andre stadar. Men for ein sommerfugl er det som om det ikkje finst noko der ute. Sjølv plante som bottlebrush, som tiltrekkjer mange insekter for nektar, gjev ikkje mat til innfødde babyinsekter. Det er litt som å ha ein bar for vaksne som drikk, men ikkje har mat å gje borna sine, slik at dei kan vokse opp til å vere voksne.  Men Doug Tallamy, ein entomolog ved University of Delaware, seier at vi kan hjelpa. Ved å ha nokre lokale planter i hagen vår kan me gje dei maten dei treng for å koma tilbake til jorda.  Då vi var klar for å byggja om hagen vår frå eit sted med grønne planter, til eit engelskt hus med gardiner, skjedde det noko. Me såg Doug Tallamy snakke på eit konferanseprogram i Silicon Valley. Og me fekk på ein måte grepet om at me måtte skifte retning og starte å arbeide i hagen vår med lokale folk.  Når me ser på hagen vår, er det viktig at vi berre byrjar... Det er eit stort eksperiment for å finne ut kva som er best. Og sjølvsagt, hagen talar til oss. Det blåa auga graset har hoppa over den asfalterte gangveggen til ein annan del av hagen! Me ventar på å få meir beveging og magi i framtida. Her er nokre av dei me kan tenke på i hagen vår.  Velsigningar... med eit stort eiketrær i hagen vår, og ein bekk så langt bak oss.  Ulempa er at det er mykje skugge. Det er berre to eller tre stader i hagen vår som har mykje sol. Så me la oss freiste å finne ut kva som helst som kunne stå i skugga. (Dersom du ikkje har møtt Calscape før, er du i for ein traktasjon. Eg vonar du bur i California, men...  Målet vårt er at ein skal kunne ta vare på økosystemet slik at vi kan vere aktive i arbeidet med å dyrka grøne bilar. Og korleis vert ein av desse? Vel, vi har berre sett ein eller to styra så langt. Sigh. Åh, eg veit ikkje. Det er berre eit eksperiment.  Det største problemet var at ho ikkje klarde å legge igjen bladet heile året. Vi kan sjå at jorda har endra seg, og kvar gong me gjer det, ser me at terningen aukar med insektane. Så det er det som skjer. Sakte og greit...  Så me held fram med å erstatte dei med urfolk. Sist helg tok vi ut Sarcococca og Pierris Japonicas og erstatta dei med Coffeeberry (Frangula Californica). Denne helga trekkte vi ut to eske og erstatta dei med buska-anemone (Carpenteria Californica). Og neste helg skal vi bytte ut det med eit nytt par Coyote-egge.  I tillegg til insektane har me sett mange andre dyreverker i hagen vår. Eit nytt reir med unger blir fødd i treet kvart år. Og i år vart vi overraska av at tre små vaskebjørn flytta inn i treet (det er stort sett holt).  Dei er søte, skjemme og søte.

Ved å kombinera desse materialane i eit apparat som vert kalla ein transistor, kan me laga ein elektronisk komponent som berre vil lede elektrisitet når ein liten elektrisk strøm er overført til den såkalla grunnpinnen i transistoren.  Ein opplagt bruk av slik oppførsel er å bruka transistoren som ein omskiftar - ved å påføre eller ta bort strøm til basen kan vi kontrollere om transistoren fører elektrisitet via kollektoren og emitterpinene sine. Når ingen strøm er til stades ved basepin, vil transistoren blokkere elektrisk overføring gjennom sine emitter- og kollektorpin.  Generelt sett er den elektriske strømen som trengs for å styre transistoren ved basen veldig liten. Mykje større straumar kan overførast gjennom einheten gjennom kollektor- og emitterpinne. I praksis bruker ein transistor ei svært lita innleiingsstrøm for å styra flyten av ei mykje større strøm.  Et lydsignal, til dømes, vert overført som ein veldig låg effekt elektrisk stråling -- i si opprinnelege form er det for lite for å kunne drive ein høyttaler til å lage lyder som er høyrbare for det menneskelege øyret. For å forsterke dette signalet slik at det kan brukast til å spela av lyd kan me bruke lydsignalet til ein transistors basespinn -- dette vil tillata at ein mykje større strøm renn mellom sender- og samlarspinnene og gjennom transistoren. Sidan strømmen er så stor skal den reflektere den mindre strømmen av det lydlege signalet, og difor vil me ha skapt ei mykje kraftigare versjon av det originale signalet.", "output": " no, the transistor is not a signal processor. a signal processor is a device that takes a signal and changes it in some way. a transistor is a device that can be used to control the flow of electricity. it can be used to create a signal, but it is not a signal processor. a signal processor is a device that changes a signal, not a transistor. a transistor can be used to create a signal, but it is not a signal processor. a signal processor is a device that changes a signal, not a transistor. a transistor can be used to create a signal, but it is not a signal processor. a signal processor is a device that changes a signal, not a transistor. a signal processor is a device that changes a signal, not a transistor. a signal processor is a device that changes a signal, not a transistor. a signal processor is a device that changes a signal, not a transistor. a signal processor is a device that changes a signal, not a transistor. a signal processor is a device that changes a signal, not a transistor. a signal processor is a device that changes a signal, not a transistor. a signal processor is a device that changes a signal, not a transistor. a signal processor is a device that changes a signal"}

Statistisk sett er det enkelt å sjå eit mønster som viser kva som er vakkert. Eit tydeleg døme på dette fenomenet er ein skjønnhetsstandard for kvinner og menn. Samfunnet verkar vera samd om kva som er vakkert, både fysisk og indre. Skjønnhetsstandarden er òg projisert bortanfor menneske, på dyreraser, til dømes i kattutstillingar. Det ser ut til å eksistere eit samband mellom skjønnhet og kor nært det liknar fullendinga.

Til dømes er store auge statistikkvis rekna som meir attraktive, men i termer av sitt biologiske formål har dei ingen overleg over små auge. Både skjønnhet og fullkommenhet avhenger difor av perspektivet eller føremålet du ser på eit objekt med.  I tillegg bør ein ta med i betrakninga dei tydelege svingingane gjennom århundrar og kulturar på kva som vert sett på som vakkert. Mode-trender og kunststylar, til dømes, endrar seg stadig. I tillegg tyder mangfoldet av meiningar at det ikkje finst noko som alle kan rekna som vakkert, så sjølv om dei fleste ser på eit bestemt objekt eller ei ting som vakker, er skjønnheten subjektiv fordi den er basert på ei stadig skiftende preferanse i staden for den objektive sanninga.", "output": " Objective or subjective?

Dette er viktig fordi ulike aktivaklassar er påverka meir eller mindre av kortsiktige marknadstilstander. Avhengig av kor lang tid du vil ha eksponering for marknaden, er det svært viktig å velja ein type eiendel som passar inn i din tidshorisont.  - Risikoprofil: Anger kor komfortabel du er med innverknaden svingande marknadstilfelder har på investeringane dine.

For example, in Europe, the Swiss franc has a high interest rate and is a safe investment. In contrast, the US dollar has a lower interest rate and is more volatile. So, the investor would have to consider the risks and returns of each currency before making a decision. Additionally, the investor should consider the inflation rate, which can affect the currency value. Finally, the investor should consider the investment horizon, which is the length of time the investment is planned to last. This can also affect the currency choice. For example, if the investor plans to invest for the long-term, the Swiss franc may be a good option. Otherwise, the US dollar may be a better choice. The investor can also consider investing in a diversified portfolio of currencies, which can help mitigate the risks. Investing in currencies can be a complex and risky investment. It is important to conduct thorough research and consult with a financial advisor before making any decisions. Additionally, the investor should be aware of the potential currency exchange rates and the potential risks associated with currency trading.

Tesla er ein av dei meste verdsatte selskapene i verda og er, frå 2023, den største bilprodusenten i verda. I 2021 hadde selskapet det meste salget i verda av batteridrevne elbilar og plug-in elektriske bilar, med 21% av batteri-elektriske (rent elektriske) marknad og 14% av plug-in marknaden (som inkluderer plug-in hybridbilar). Ved hjelp av datterselskapet Tesla Energy utviklar og installerar selskapet fotovoltaiske system i USA. Tesla Energy er òg ein av dei største globale leverandørane av batteri-energilagringssystem, med 3,99 gigawatt-timer (GWh) installert i 2021.  Tesla blei grunnlagt i juli 2003 av Martin Eberhard og Marc Tarpenning som Tesla Motors. Namnet på selskapet er ein hyllest til oppfinnaren og elektriske ingeniøren Nikola Tesla. I februar 2004 blei Elon Musk den største aksjonæren i selskapet, etter å ha investert 6,5 millionar dollar. Han har vore administrerande direktør sidan 2008. Musk seier at målet med Tesla er å hjelpa til med å fremje overgangen til bærekraftig transport og energi, som er oppnådd gjennom elektriske bilar og solenergi. Tesla starta produksjonen av den første bilmodellen, Roadster sportsbilen, i 2008.

Historien byrjar i Trantor, hovudstaden i det 12.000 år gamle galaktiske imperiet, som var mektig men langsomt på veg mot undergang. Hari Seldon, ein matematikar og psykolog, har utvikla psykohistorie, eit nytt fagområde innan vitskap og psykologi som behandler alle høve i store samfunn med matematikk, og som gjer det mogleg å forutsei framtidige hendingar.  Ved hjelp av psykohistorie har Seldon oppdaga nedgangen og den endelege fallet til imperiet, og det har gjort dei aristokratiske medlemmane av kommisjonen for offentleg tryggleik, de facto-herskarane i imperiet, rasende. Kommisjonen reknar meiningane og utsegna til Seldon som svik, og han blir arrestert saman med den unge matematikaren Gaal Dornick, som er komen til Trantor for å bli med i gruppa til Seldon. Seldon vert dømt av kommisjonen; han forsvarer trua si, og forklarer teoriane og forutseiningane sine, inkludert trua si på at imperiet vil kollapsa om 300 år, og at medan det andre imperiet til slutt vil stiga, vil det berre koma etter ein mørk tidsalder på 30.000 år. Han informerer kommisjonen om at ein alternativ til denne framtida er oppnåelig og forklarer til dei at det å skapa eit sammendrag av all menneskeleg kunnskap, Encyclopedia Galactica, ikkje kan hindra det uunngåelege fallet til imperiet, men ville redusera den mørke tida til eit tusenår.  Den skeptiske kommisjonen, som ikkje ville gjera Seldon til martyr, tilbyr han utlegning til ein avlägsen verd, Terminus, saman med andre som kunne hjelpa han med å skapa encyklopediet. Han godtar tilbodet, forbereder seg til å forlate \"Encyclopedists\" og får eit keisarleg dekret som offisielt anerkjenner handlingane hans. Seldon informerer Dornick om at, til trass for at Imperiet trudde dei hadde vunne ved å forvisa Seldon, var utfallet akkurat det han hadde sett seg føre og håpa på. \"Terminus\" ville vore heimstaden for den fyrste grunnlegginga medan den andre grunnlegginga ville ha vore \"at Star's End\".

Arbeidet vart fullført i august 1940, då ho blei innleidd i den tyske flåten. Bismarck og systerskipet Tirpitz var dei største slagskipa som Tyskland nokon gong hadde bygd, og to av dei største som nokon europeisk makt hadde bygd.  I løpet av den åtte månader lange karrieren til krigsskipet, gjennomførte Bismarck berre ein einaste offensiv operasjon som varte i åtte dagar i mai 1941, med kodenavnet Rheinübung. Skipet, saman med den tunge kryssaren Prinz Eugen, skulle bryta seg inn i Atlanterhavet og raida allierte skip frå Nord-Amerika til Storbritannia. Dei to skipa blei oppdaga fleire gonger utanfor Skandinavia, og britiske flåteeinheter blei utplassert for å blokkera rutan deira. I slaget ved Danmarksundet møtte slagkryssaren HMS Hood Prinz Eugen, kanskje ved ein feil, medan HMS Prince of Wales møtte Bismarck. I det etterfølgjande slaget blei Hood øydelagd av den kombinerte brannen frå Bismarck og Prinz Eugen, som så skadde Prince of Wales og tvinga henne til å trekkje seg tilbake. Bismarck fekk nok skade frå tre treingar frå Prince of Wales til å tvinga ein slutt på raidingmisjonen.  Ødelegginga av Hood førte til ei urolege jaktsporing av Royal Navy med dusinvis av krigsskip. To dagar seinare, på veg til det okkuperte Frankrike for å gjennomføre reparasjonar, blei Bismarck angripe av femten Fairey Swordfish torpedobomber frå hangarskipet HMS Ark Royal. I det siste slaget dagen etter blei Bismarck angripe av to britiske slagskip og to tunge kryssarar, og fekk stor skade og store tap av menneskeliv. Skipet vart søkkt for å hindra at britane skulle ta skipet, og for å tillate at skipet blei forlate for å avverga fleire tap.

Gamle egyptiske tekster frå 2750 f.Kr. omtalte desse fiskane som \"Thunderer av Nilen\", og omtalte dei som \"vernarane\" for alle andre fiskar. Elektriske fiskar blei på nytt rapportert tusenår seinare av naturvitskapsmenn og leger i antikken, gresk, romersk og arabisk. Fleire gamle forfattarar, som Plinius den eldre og Scribonius Largus, vitna om den nummende effekten av elektriske støt frå elektriske havkatar og elektriske strålar, og visste at slike støt kunne ferdast langs ledande objekt. Patientar med sjukdomar som gikt eller hovudverk blei instruerte til å røra elektrisk fisk i håp om at det mektige skokket kunne lækja dei. Gamle kulturar rundt Middelhavet visste at visse gjenstandar, som stavar av rav, kunne reinsa med kattens pels for å tiltrekka lettare gjenstandar som fjøyr. Thales frå Mileto gjorde ei rekkje observasjonar på statisk elektrisitet rundt 600 f.Kr., og han trudde at friksjon gjorde amber magnetisk, i motsetnad til mineral som magnetit, som ikkje trengde å slitas. Thales hadde ikkje rett i å tru at tiltrekninga var på grunn av ein magnetisk effekt, men seinare ville vitskapen visa ein samband mellom magnetisme og elektrisitet. I samsvar med ein kontroversiell teori, kan parthiarane ha hatt kunnskap om galvanisering, basert på oppdaginga i 1936 av Bagdad-batteriet, som liknar ein galvanisk celle, sjølv om det er usikkert om artefaktet var elektrisk av natur. Elektrisitet blei berre ei intellektuell nysgjerrigheit i tusenår fram til 1600, då den engelske vitskapsmannen William Gilbert skreiv De Magnete, der han gjorde ein nøye studie av elektrisitet og magnetisme, og skilde lodestone-effekten frå statisk elektrisitet som blei produsert ved å slita amber. Han skapte det nylatinske ordet electricus (\"av rav\" eller \"lik rav\", elektron, det greske ordet for \"rav\") for å referere til eigenskapen til å tiltrekka små objekt etter å ha blitt gnidd. Denne samanhengan gav opphav til dei engelske orda \"electric\" og \"electricity\", som første gong blei trykte i Pseudodoxia Epidemica av Thomas Browne i 1646. I det 17. og tidleg 18. århundret blei det utført fleire arbeid av Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray og C. F. du Fay. Seinare på 1700-talet utførte Benjamin Franklin omfattande forsking i elektrisitet, og selde eigedomane sine for å finansiera arbeidet sitt. I juni 1752 er han kjend for å ha festt ein metallnøkkel på botnen av ei fukta drage og fløy dragen i ei stormtrugande himmel. Ei rekkje gnister som hoppa frå nøkkelen til baksidan av handa hans viste at lynet verkeleg var elektrisk av natur. Han forklarte òg den tilsynelatande paradoksale atferda til Leyden-krukken som ein apparat for å lagra store mengder elektrisk lading i form av elektrisitet som bestod av både positive og negative ladingar. I 1775 fortalde Hugh Williamson til Royal Society om ei rekkje eksperiment som hadde med elektriske støt frå ålen; same året skildra kirurgen og anatom John Hunter strukturen til elektriske organ i fisken. I 1791 publiserte Luigi Galvani oppdaginga si av bioelektromagnetikk, og han viste at elektrisitet var middelet som neuronane overførte signal til musklane. Batteriet til Alessandro Volta, eller voltaic pile, frå 1800, laga av skiftande lag av sink og kopar, gav vitskapsmenn ein pålitelegare kjelde til elektrisk energi enn dei elektrostatiske maskinane som var blitt brukt tidlegare. Oppdaginga av elektromagnetisme, eininga mellom elektriske og magnetiske fenomen, er skulda til Hans Christian Ørsted og André-Marie Ampère i 1819-1820. Michael Faraday fann opp den elektriske motoren i 1821, og Georg Ohm matematisk analyserte den elektriske kretsen i 1827. Elektrisitet og magnetisme (og lys) blei definitivt knytt saman av James Clerk Maxwell, særleg i hans \"On Physical Lines of Force\" i 1861 og 1862.  Medan tidleg på 1800-talet hadde det vore raske framskritt i elektrisk vitskap, var det seinare på 1800-talet som det blei gjort størst framskritt i elektroteknikk. Ved hjelp av folk som Alexander Graham Bell, Ottó Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1. baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla og George Westinghouse, gjekk elektrisitet frå å vera ein vitskapleg nysgjerrigheit til å bli eit viktig verktøy for det moderne livet. I 1887 oppdaga Heinrich Hertz at elektrodar opplyst med ultraviolett lys lettare skaper elektriske gnistar. I 1905 publiserte Albert Einstein eit papir som forklarte eksperimentelle data frå den fotoelektriske effekten som eit resultat av at lysenergi blir frakta i diskrete kvantepakkar, som gir energi til elektronar. Denne oppdaginga førte til den kvante-revolusjonen. Einstein fekk Nobelprisen i fysikk i 1921 for \"oppdaginga av loven om den fotoelektriske effekten\". Den fotoelektriske effekten blir òg brukt i fotokjellar som solcellepaneler. Den fyrste solidstate-enheten var \"cat's whisker detector\" som blei brukt første gong på 1900-talet i radio-mottakarar. Ein viskeliknande tråd vert sett i lett kontakt med ein fast krystall (slik som ein germanium krystall) for å oppdaga eit radiosignal ved kontaktknyteffekten. I ein solid-state komponent, er strømmen avgrensa til faste element og samansetningar utforma spesielt for å skifta og forsterka den. Strømmen kan skiljast i to former: som negativt ladde elektronar, og som positivt ladde elektronmanglar kalla hull. Desse ladningane og hullene er kjend som kvantfysikk. Bygningsmaterialet er oftast ein krystallinsk halvleiar. Solid-state elektronikk kom til si eiga plass med oppstoen av transistor teknologi. Den første fungerande transistoren, ein germanium-basert punkt-kontakt transistor, blei oppfunnen av John Bardeen og Walter Houser Brattain ved Bell Labs i 1947, følgd av den bipolare krysstransistoren i 1948.", "target": "Den fyrste solidstate-enheten var \"cat's whisker detector\" som blei brukt første gong på 1900-talet i radio-mottakarar.

Tradisjonelt er triathlon ein individuell idrett der kvar idrettsutøvar kjemper mot banen og klokken for å få den beste tida.

Resultatet blir vanlegvis lagt ut på offisielle nettsteder og viser for kvar triatlet sin svømmetid, syklustid (med omsetjingar inkludert), løptid og totaltid. Nokre rasar har òg sett opp endringstid for seg sjølv.  Andre reglar for triatlon varierer frå kappløp til kappløp, og generelt inneber dei beskrivingar av tillatte utstyr (til dømes er våtdraktar tillate i USAT-event i svømmefasen av nokre kappløp når vasstemperaturen er under 25,6 °C (78,1 °F)), og forbod mot forstyrring mellom idrettsutøvarar. I tillegg er bruken av flipper eller andre hjelpemiddel til å svømme fram og flyte ulovleg i triatlon og kan føra til diskvalifisering.  Ein regel som gjeld sykkelbenet er at helmen må setjast på før ein monterer (eller i visse jurisdiksjonar tek i besittelse) sykkelen, og han må vera på til ein har sett seg av. Ein kan ikkje krevja at ein bär hjelm når ein ikkje er på sykkelen (til dømes når ein reparerer eit mekanisk problem). Feil etter denne regelen vil føra til diskvalifisering. I tillegg skal alle sykkel på sykkelbanen drivast berre med menneskeleg kraft og kraft. Annar enn å driva ein sykkel, er alle framdrifta som kjem av bruken av hendene, forbode. Dersom sykkelen til ein utøvar funkar ikkje, kan han eller ho fortsette med kappløpet så lenge han eller ho er på sykkelen. Det finst òg strenge reglar for \"sykkelmontering\". Konkursanter kan ikkje byrja å ri sykkelen sin ut av overgang før dei er over ei klårt markert linje. Ein kan bli straffa for å ha sett seg på sykkelen før dette (eksempel: ein 15-sekunders tidstraff ved OL i London 2012 blei pålagt Jonathan Brownlee, ein utøvar frå Storbritannia, for å ha sett seg på sykkelen for tidleg.)

Ein annan avgjørende påverknad var den cubanske nasjonshelten Jose Martí, som skreiv prosa og dikt. Det siste elementet som definerer estetikken til Darius er hans beundring for symbolistane, særleg Paul Verlaine.

(og i hovudet mitt: Verlaine...!) \" Så, når du seier farvel: \"Gamle mann, det er viktig å seia: kona mi er frå landet mitt; kjæresten min er frå Paris\".  Los raros er eit illustrativt volum om litterære smaker, som han gav ut på same år som Prosas profanas, og dedikerte til å kort glossa nokre av forfattarane og intellektuelle han følde djup beundring for. Blant dei i boka finn vi Edgar Allan Poe, Villiers de l'Isle Adam, Léon Bloy, Paul Verlaine, Lautréamont, Eugénio de Castro og José Martí (den siste er den einaste som er nemnd som skreiv sitt litterære verk på spansk). Fransk kultur er overvektig. Darío skreiv: \"Modernismen er ikkje meir enn spansk dikt og prosa som er sett gjennom det fine sivet av det gode franske dikt og den gode franske prosa\". Han la til side den første fasen, før Azul..., der dikta hans skulda mykje til dei store namnene i spansk poesi på 1800-talet, som Núñez de Arce og Campoamor, og var ein stor beundrar av Bécquer. Spanske tema er godt representert i hans arbeid, allereie i Prosas profanas og særleg etter hans andre reise til Spania i 1899. Han var medviten om den samtidige spanske dekadensen i politikk og kunst (ein preoccupasjon han delte med den såkalla Generation of '98), og han var ofte inspirert av karakterar og element frå fortida. Når det gjeld forfattarar på andre språk, er det verdt å nevna at han følde ei djup beundring for tre forfattarar frå USA: Ralph Waldo Emerson, Edgar Allan Poe og Walt Whitman.

Ideen om at husplanter har ein merkbar effekt på luftkvaliteten innendørs er i stor grad basert på Clean Air Study som NASA gjennomførte på 1980-talet. I undersøkelsen blei det prøvd planter i forsegla kamrar og med høgt nivå av flyktige organiske samansetningar (særleg bensin, trikloretilen og formaldehyd).

Husplanter har ein statistisk signifikant effekt på konsentrasjonane av både karbonmonoksid og karbondioksid i normale innendørsmiljø, og reduserer karbondioksidnivå med 10-25% og karbonmonoksidnivå med opptil 90%.

{"model_name": "wenge-research/yayi-7b", "input": "Kor mange år har NATO eksistert?\nContext:Traktaten i Dunkirk blei underskriven av Frankrike og Storbritannia den 4. mars 1947, i følgje av andre verdskrigen og byrjinga av den kalde krigen, som ei pakt om allians og gjensidig hjelp i tilfelle av moglege angrep frå Tyskland eller Sovjetunionen. I mars 1948 blei denne alliansen utvida i Brysseltraktaten til å inkludere Benelux-landa, og danna Brysseltraktatorganisasjonen, som var kjent som Western Union. Samtal om ein breiare militær allianse, som kunne omfatta Nord-Amerika, byrja òg den same månaden i USA, der utanrikspolitikken deira under Truman-doktrinen fremja internasjonal solidaritet mot handlingar dei såg på som kommunistisk aggresjon, som statskuppet i Tsjekkoslovakia i februar 1948. Desse samtalane førte til underskrivinga av Nord-Atlantikk-traktaten den 4. april 1949 av medlemslandene i Western Union pluss USA, Canada, Portugal, Italia, Noreg, Danmark og Island. Den kanadiske diplomaten Lester B. Pearson var ein sentral forfattar og utarbeider av avtalen.  Det var eit langt rektangulært rom med fleire rekkjer med sitjande individar på kvar side, og flagg som hang i den andre enden. Vest-Tyskland blei med i NATO i 1955, som førte til danninga av den rivaliserande Warszawapakta under den kalde krigen. Nord-Atlantikk-traktaten var i stor grad sovende til Korea-krigen førte til etableringa av NATO for å implementera den med ein integrert militær struktur. Dette inkluderte danninga av Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) i 1951, som adopterte mange av dei militære strukturane og planane til Western Union, inkludert avtala om standardisering av utstyr og avtala om stasjonering av utenlandske militære styrkar i europeiske land. I 1952 blei stillinga som generalsekretær i NATO etablert som den fremste sivile person i organisasjonen. Det året var det òg den første store maritime øvinga til NATO, øvinga Mainbrace, og Grekland og Tyrkia blei medlem av organisasjonen. Etter konferansane i London og Paris fekk Vest-Tyskland lov til å rusta seg militært, ettersom dei blei med i NATO i mai 1955, noko som var ein stor faktor i skapinga av den sovjetisk-dominerte Warszawapakta, som skilte dei to motsatte sidene i den kalde krigen.  Bygginga av Berlinmuren i 1961 markerte høgda i spenningen under den kalde krigen, då 400 000 amerikanske soldatar var stasjonerte i Europa. Tvilk om styrken av sambandet mellom dei europeiske statane og USA gjekk ned og ned, saman med tvil om troverdigheten til NATO-forsvaret mot ein framtidig sovjetisk invasjon - tvil som førte til utviklinga av eit uavhengig fransk kjernefysisk avskrekkingsapparat og uttrekkinga av Frankrike frå NATOs militære struktur i 1966. I 1982 blei det nydemokratiske Spania med i alliansen.  Revolusjonane i 1989 i Europa førte til ein strategisk omvaluering av NATOs føremål, natur, oppgåver og fokus på kontinentet. I oktober 1990 blei Aust-Tyskland ein del av Forbundsrepublikken Tyskland og alliansen, og i november 1990 signerte alliansen Traktaten om konvensjonelle væpnede styrkar i Europa (CFE) i Paris med Sovjetunionen. Det gav mandat til spesifikke militære reduksjonar over heile kontinentet, som heldt fram etter kollapsen til Warszawapakta i februar 1991 og oppløysinga av Sovjetunionen i desember, som førte til at de facto hovudmotstandarane til NATO blei fjerna. Dette starta ein nedtrekking av militære utgifter og utstyr i Europa. CFE-traktaten gav underskrivarane lov til å fjerna 52.000 konvensjonelle våpen i løpet av dei neste seksten åra, og lét militærutgiftane til NATOs europeiske medlemmar gå ned med 28 prosent frå 1990 til 2015. I 1990 gav fleire vestlege leiarar Mikhail Gorbatsjov forsikring om at NATO ikkje ville utvida seg lenger aust, slik det blei avslørt i memorandum frå private samtalar. Den endelege teksten til traktaten om den endelege oppgjøret med Tyskland, som blei underskriven seinare det året, inneheldt likevel ingen omtale av spørsmålet om ekspansjon mot aust.  To høge betongdel av ein vegg i ein grasmark framfor ein buet bygning med blåglassvinduer. Fallen av Berlinmuren i 1989 markerte eit vendepunkt i NATOs rolle i Europa, og denne delen av muren er no utstilt utanfor NATO-hovedkvarteret. På 1990-talet utvida organisasjonen aktivitetane sine til politisk og humanitær situasjonar som ikkje før hadde vore NATO-angrep. Under oppløysinga av Jugoslavia utførte organisasjonen sine første militære inngrep i Bosnia frå 1992 til 1995 og seinare i Jugoslavia i 1999. Desse konfliktane var grunnlaget for ei stor militær omstrukturering etter den kalde krigen. Den militære strukturen til NATO blei redusert og reorganisert, med nye styrkar som Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps.  Politisk søkte organisasjonen betre relasjonar til dei nyutdannede autonome statane i Sentral- og Aust-Europa, og diplomatiske forum for regionalt samarbeid mellom NATO og naboane blei oppretta i denne perioden etter den kalde krigen, inkludert Partnerskap for fred og Middelhavsdialoginitiativet i 1994, Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council i 1997 og NATO-Russland Permanent Joint Council i 1998. På toppmøtet i Washington i 1999 blei Ungarn, Polen og Tsjekkia offisielt medlem av NATO, og organisasjonen gav òg ut nye retningslinjer for medlemskap med individuelle \"Membership Action Plans\". Desse planane styrte den etterfølgjande tilletinga av nye alliansemedlemmar. Valet av den franske presidenten Nicolas Sarkozy i 2007 førte til ei stor reform av den franske militærposisjonen, som kulminerte med at Frankrike fekk fullt medlemskap 4. april 2009, og som òg inkluderte at Frankrike kom tilbake til NATOs militære kommandostruktur, samstundes med å oppretthalda eit sjølvstendig kjernefysisk avskrekkingsapparat.  Artikkel 5 i den nordatlantiske traktaten, som krev at medlemsland skal hjelpa alle medlemsland som blir utsatt for eit væpent angrep, blei brukt for første og einaste gongen etter angrepene 11. september, ettersom troppar blei deploert til Afghanistan under NATO-ledde ISAF. Organisasjonen har hatt fleire oppgåver sidan den tid, som å senda utlærarar til Irak, å hjelpa til i operasjonar mot piratkopiering, og i 2011 å innføra ei flyforbudssone over Libya i samsvar med FN-tryggleiksraadsresolusjon 1973.  Russlands anneksjon av Krim førte til sterk fordømming av alle NATO-medlemmar, og var ein av sju gonger som artikkel 4, som krev samråd mellom NATO-medlemmar, har blitt brukt. Tidlegare tid inkluderte under Irak-krigen og den syriske borgarkrigen. På toppmøtet i Wales i 2014 forplikta leiarane i NATO-medlemstatane seg for første gong formelt til å bruke minst to prosent av bruttonasjonalproduktet sitt på forsvar innen 2024, noko som tidlegare berre hadde vore ein uformell rettleiing. På toppmøtet i Warszawa i 2016 var NATO-land samde om opprettinga av NATO Enhanced Forward Presence, som hadde fire multinasjonelle bataljon-størrelse slaggrupper i Estland, Latvia, Litauen og Polen. Før og under den russiske invasjonen av Ukraina i 2022 sende fleire NATO-land land landstroppar, krigsskip og kampfly for å forsterka den austlege flanken til alliansen, og fleire land påkalde seg Artikkel 4 igjen. I mars 2022 møtte NATO-leiarane i Brussel til eit ekstraordinært toppmøte der òg leiarane i G7 og EU deltok. NATO-medlemsland var samde om å oppretta fire tilleggs slaggrupper i Bulgaria, Ungarn, Romania og Slovakia, og element av NATO Response Force blei aktivert for første gong i NATOs historie.  Frå juni 2022 hadde NATO sett ut 40.000 soldatar langs den 2.500 kilometer lange austflanken sin for å avskrekka russisk aggresjon. Meir enn halvparten av dette talet har vorte utplassert i Bulgaria, Romania, Ungarn, Slovakia og Polen, som er fem land som samanlagt har 259.000 soldatar. For å utfylla det bulgarske luftvåpenet, sende Spania Eurofighter Typhoon, Nederland sende åtte F-35 angrepsfly, og fleire franske og amerikanske angrepsfly skulle snart koma.

Petrifikasjon er resultatet av at eit tre eller treliknande planter er blitt erstatta med stein gjennom ein mineraliseringsprosess som ofte inkluderer permineralisering og erstatning. Dei organiske materialane som utgjer cellemurane har blitt kopierte med mineral (trass alt silisium i form av opal, kalkedon eller kvarts). I nokre tilfelle kan den opphavlege strukturen til stamvevet delvis bli verande. I motsetnad til andre fossil plantar, som er typisk avtrykk eller kompresjonar, er fossilt tre tre-dimensjonalt representasjon av det originale organiske materialet.  Petrifikasjonsprosessen skjer under jorda, når tre blir gravlagd i vatn eller vulkansk aske. Tilstedeværinga av vatn reduserer tilgjengeligheten av oksygen som hemmar aerob nedbryting av bakteriar og sopp. Minerallastande vatn som renn gjennom sediment kan føra til permineralisering, som skjer når mineral fell ut av oppløsning og fyller innsiden av celler og andre tomme rom. Under utskifting fungerer celleveggene til planten som ein mal for mineralisering. Det må finnast ein balanse mellom forfallet av cellulose og lignin og mineralmaling for at cellulardetaljer skal kunna haldast på. Det meste av det organiske materialet bryter seg ofte ned, men noko av ligninet kan bli verande. Silika i form av opal-A, kan inkrusta og gjennomtrenga tre relativt raskt i varme kjelder.

{"model_name": "wenge-research/yayi-7b", "input": "Deskriver kvantitativ letting i tre punktar eller mindre.\nContext:Kvantitativ letting (QE) er ein pengepolitisk handling der ein sentralbank kjøper forhåndsbestemde mengder statsobligasjonar eller andre finansielle eiendeler for å stimulera økonomisk aktivitet. Kvantitativ letting er ein ny form for pengepolitikk som blei brukt i stor grad etter finanskrisen i 2007-2008. Det er meint å avlaste ein økonomisk tilbakegang når inflasjonen er svært låg eller negativ, og gjer den vanlege pengepolitikken ineffektiv. Kvantitativ innstramming (QT) gjer det motsatte, der ein sentralbank av pengepolitiske grunner sel av ein del av behaldet sitt av statsobligasjonar eller andre finansielle eiendeler.  I likhet med konvensjonelle markedsoperasjonar som blir brukt til å gjennomføre pengepolitikken, gjennomfører ein sentralbank kvantitativ letting ved å kjøpa finansielle eiendeler frå kommersielle bankar og andre finansinstitusjonar, og dermed heva prisane på desse finansielle eiendelene og senka avkastinga, samstundes med å auka pengemengden. I motsetnad til normal politikk inneber kvantitativ letting likevel vanlegvis kjøp av risikofyltare eller langsiktigare eigedomar (i staden for kortsiktige statsobligasjonar) av førebestemte mengder i stor skala, over ein tidsperiode som er fastsett på førehand.  Sentralbankar brukar vanlegvis kvantitative lettingar når det nominelle rentemålet nærmar seg eller når null. Veldig låge rentar fører til ein likviditetsfelle, ein situasjon der folk foretrekker å ha kontanter eller svært likvide eiendeler, med tanke på den låge avkastinga på andre finansielle eiendeler. Dette gjer det vanskeleg for rentene å gå under null; pengeautoritetane kan då bruka kvantitativ letting for å stimulera økonomien endå meir i staden for å prøva å senka rentene vidare.  Kvantitative lettingar kan bidra til å få økonomien ut av resesjon og bidra til å sikre at inflasjonen ikkje fell under sentralbankens inflasjonsmål.

Ordet laser er eit akronym som opphavleg er ein akronym for lysforsterking ved stimulert stråling. Den første laseren blei bygd i 1960 av Theodore Maiman ved Hughes Research Laboratories, basert på teoretisk arbeid av Charles H. Townes og Arthur Leonard Schawlow.  Ein laser skil seg frå andre lyskjelder ved at han sender ut lys som er samanhengande. Romslig samanheng gjer det mogleg for ein laser å fokusera på eit stramt punkt, slik at applikasjonar som laserskjæring og litografi blir mogleg. Romslig samanheng gjer det òg mogleg for ein laserstråle å vera smal over store avstandar (kollimering), og dette gjer det mogleg å bruka applikasjonar som laserpeker og lidar (lysdeteksjon og avstand). Laser kan òg ha høg tidskoherens, som gjer at dei kan senda ut lys med eit svært smal spektrum. Alternativt kan tidskoherens bli brukt til å produsera ultrakorte pulsar av lys med eit bredt spekter, men varar så kort som femtosekund.  Laser blir brukt i optiske diskdrev, laserprinterar, strekkode skannarar, DNA-sekvenseringsinstrument, fiberoptisk og fri-rom optisk kommunikasjon, halvleiar-chipproduksjon (fotolitografi), laserkirurgi og hudbehandlingar, skjæring og sveising av materiale, militære og rettshåndhevande apparat for å markere mål og måle avstand og fart, og i lysskjermer med laser for underhaldning. Halvleiarlasarar i det blå til nær-UV har òg blitt brukt i staden for lysdiodar (LED) for å stimulera fluoresens som ein kjelde til kvit lys.

Individar, organisasjonar og nasjonar er utrusta med eller tilegnar særskilde evner, og dei kjem i kombinasjonar eller handel for å utnytta evnene til andre i tillegg til sine eigne. Spesialiserte kapasitetar kan omfatta utstyr eller naturressursar så vel som ferdigheter. Utdanning og kombinasjonar av utstyr og andre ressursar som verkar saman er ofte viktige. Ein kan til dømes spesialisera seg ved å skaffa seg verktøy og ferdighetene til å bruka dei effektivt, på same måten som ei organisasjon kan spesialisera seg ved å skaffa særskilt utstyr og henta eller trena dyktige operatørar. Arbeidsdeling er motivet for handel og kjelda til økonomisk gjensidig avhengigheit.  Historisk sett er ein auke i arbeidsdeling assosiert med veksten i totalutgang og handel, framveksten av kapitalismen, og den auke i kompleksiteten til industrialiserte prosessar. Konseptet og gjennomføringa av arbeidsdeling har vorte sett i den gamle sumeriske (mesopotamiske) kulturen, der tildeling av arbeid i nokre byar samla seg med ein auke i handel og økonomisk gjensidig avhengighet. Arbeidsdeling fører generelt til ein økning i produktiviteten til både produsentane og den enkelte arbeidaren.  Etter den neolittiske revolusjonen førte gjerdet og landbruket til meir pålitelege og rike matforsyningar, som auka folkesetnaden og førte til spesialisering av arbeid, inkludert nye klassar av handverkarar, krigarar og utviklinga av elite. Denne spesialiseringa blei forsterka av industrialiseringsprosessen og fabrikkar i den industrielle revolusjonen. Difor var mange klassiske økonomer og nokre mekaniske ingeniørar, som Charles Babbage, fortalarar for arbeidsdeling. I tillegg, ved å la arbeidarar utføra einskilde eller begrensede oppgåver, vart den lange opplæringstida som var nødvendig for å trene handverkarar, utskifta med mindre lønna, men meir produktive, uferdige arbeidarar.", "target": "Generelt er følgjande fordeler knytte til å auka arbeidsdeling: - auka i den totale handelen - auke i den totale produksjonen - ein auke i marknadsaktiviteten - auka spesialisering - auka kompleksitet i industriserte prosessar", "output": " Det er som helt forstår i denne artikelen at arbeidsdeling er motivet for handel og kjelda til økonomisk gjensidig avhengigheit.

Det er det største av dei fire delstatane i Kongeriket Nederland. Nederland består av tolv provinsar. Landet grensar til Tyskland i aust og Belgia i sør, og har ein kystlinje mot Nordsjøen i nord og vest. Det deler sjøgrenser med Storbritannia, Tyskland og Belgia i Nordsjøen. Det offisielle språket i landet er nederlandsk, med vestfrisian som eit sekundært offisielt språk i provinsen Friesland. Nederlandsk, engelsk og papiamento er offisielle i dei karibiske områda.   Dei fire største byane i Nederland er Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Haag og Utrecht. Amsterdam er den mest folkerike byen i landet og den nominelle hovudstaden. Haag er sete for stats- og regjeringsrådet og Høyesterett. Rotterdamhavna er den travlaste havna i Europa. Schiphol er den travlaste flyplassen i Nederland, og den tredje travlaste i Europa. Nederland er grunnleggjande medlem av EU, Eurozonen, G10, NATO, OECD og WTO, og ein del av Schengen-området og den trilaterale Benelux-unionen. Det vert vert vert for fleire mellomstatlege organisasjonar og internasjonale domstoler, mange av dei har hovudkvarter i Haag.   Nederland tyder bokstaveleg \"lavere land\" med referanse til den låge høgda og flate topografien, med nesten 26% som ligg under havnivå. Dei fleste av områda under havnivå, kjende som polder, er resultatet av landutvinning som byrja på 1300-talet. I den republikanske perioden, som byrja i 1588, gjekk Nederland inn i ein einastående epoke med politisk, økonomisk og kulturell storleik, og blei rekna som ein av dei mektigaste og mest innverknade i Europa og verda. Denne perioden er kjend som den nederlandske gullalderen. I løpet av denne tida etablerte dei nederlandske handelsselskapane, Dutch East India Company og Dutch West India Company, koloniar og handelsstader over heile verda.   Med ein folkesetnad på 17,8 millionar, alle som bur på eit totalareal på 41 850 km2 (dette er 33 500 km2) er Nederland det 16. tettest befolka landet i verda og det andre tettest befolka landet i EU, med ein tetthet på 531 innbyggjarar per kvadratkilometer. Likevel er landet den nest største eksportøren av mat og landbruksprodukter i verda etter verdi, på grunn av den fruktbare jorda, det milde klimaet, det intensive landbruket og oppfinninga.   Nederland har vore eit parlamentarisk konstitusjonelt monarki med ein einarkistisk struktur sidan 1848. Landet har ei tradisjon for samanhengan og ei lang historie med sosial toleranse, har legalisert abort, prostitusjon og eutanasi, og har halde fram med ei liberal narkotikapolitikk.
