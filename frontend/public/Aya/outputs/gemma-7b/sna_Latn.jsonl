In 2010, the Zimbabwe government introduced a comprehensive sexuality education curriculum in schools, which includes information on HIV prevention, STIs, and reproductive health. The curriculum also covers topics such as gender equality, sexual orientation, and consent. However, the implementation of the curriculum has been slow, and many schools have not yet adopted it.\nThere are many challenges to teaching sex education in Zimbabwe. One of the main challenges is the stigma surrounding sex and sexuality. Many people in Zimbabwe are uncomfortable talking about sex, and there is a lack of openness and transparency about sexual health and reproductive rights. This makes it difficult for young people to access information about sex and sexuality, and to have open and honest conversations with their parents, teachers, and other adults.\nAnother challenge is the lack of resources and training for teachers.
