I would also need to consider factors such as shipping costs, return policies, and customer reviews before making a purchase.\n\nOnce I have made a purchase, I would need to follow the platform's instructions for checking out and completing the transaction. I would also need to keep track of my order status and any updates or notifications from the platform.\n\nAfter receiving my purchase, I would need to inspect it for any damage or defects and follow the platform's return policy if necessary. I would also need to provide feedback or reviews on the product and the platform to help other customers make informed decisions.\n\nOverall, online shopping can be a convenient and efficient way to purchase products, but it requires careful consideration and attention to detail to ensure a positive experience."}

While globalization can bring many benefits, such as increased economic growth and cultural exchange, it can also pose challenges to traditional cultural identities and ways of life.\n\nOne of the main ways in which globalization can affect cultural identity is by exposing people to new ideas and values from other cultures. This can lead to a sense of cultural dislocation and confusion, as individuals struggle to reconcile their traditional beliefs and practices with those of the wider world. At the same time, globalization can also lead to the spread of dominant cultural values and practices, which can erode the unique cultural identities of minority groups.\n\nAnother way in which globalization can affect cultural identity is by creating economic opportunities and challenges. As economies become more interconnected, traditional industries and ways of life may be replaced by new technologies and global markets. This can lead to the loss of cultural traditions and practices that are tied to specific economic activities, such as agriculture or handicrafts.\n\nOverall, the impact of globalization on cultural identity is complex and multifaceted. While it can bring many benefits, it can also pose significant challenges to traditional ways of life and cultural practices. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, it is important for individuals and communities to find ways to preserve and celebrate their unique cultural identities while also engaging with the wider world."}

Your task is to count the number of substrings of S that are palindromes. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\n\n# Input Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string S.\n\n# Output Format\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer denoting the number of palindromic substrings in S.\n\n# Constraints\n\n• 1 ≤ T ≤ 10\n• 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 105\n• S consists of lowercase English letters.\n\n# Sample Input 0\n\n2\naba\naaa\n\n\n# Sample Output 0\n\n7\n6\n\n\n# Explanation 0\n\nTest Case 1: The palindromic substrings of \"aba\" are \"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"aba\", and \"aba\".\n\nTest Case 2: The palindromic substrings of \"aaa\" are \"a\", \"a\", \"a\", \"aa\", \"aa\", and \"aaa\".\n\n# Solution\n\nThe number of palindromic substrings in a string S can be calculated using the following formula:\n\n• If S is a palindrome, then the number of palindromic substrings is |S| + (|S| - 1) + (|S| - 2) + ... + 1.\n• If S is not a palindrome, then the number of palindromic substrings is |S| + (|S| - 1) + (|S| - 2) + ... + 1 - 2.\n\nThis is because every character in a palindrome is a palindromic substring, and every pair of adjacent characters in a non-palindrome is a palindromic substring.\n\nTo implement this solution, we can use a loop to iterate through each character in S. For each character, we can check if it is a palindrome. If it is, we can add its length to the count of palindromic substrings. If it is not, we can add its length minus 1 to the count of palindromic substrings.\n\nHere is the Python"}

Hei hian engtin nge shopping experience a nghawng?\n\nTranslation: What will be the shopping experience like in a futuristic grocery store with AI-powered robots?\n\nThe shopping experience in a futuristic grocery store with AI-powered robots would be quite different from what we are used to today. Robots would be used to assist customers in finding products, restocking shelves, and even preparing food. This would free up the employees to focus on other tasks such as customer service and inventory management. The use of AI would also make the shopping experience more personalized and efficient. Customers could use their smartphones or other devices to scan products and add them to their virtual shopping cart, which would be automatically updated in real-time. This would eliminate the need for physical shopping carts and reduce the amount of time spent searching for products. Overall, the shopping experience in a futuristic grocery store with AI-powered robots would be more convenient, efficient, and personalized.\n\nCan you tell me more about how the robots would assist customers in finding products and preparing food? Sure, I'd be happy to provide more information on how robots would assist customers in finding products and preparing food in a futuristic grocery store.\n\nFor finding products, robots would be equipped with sensors and cameras to detect the location of items on the shelves. They could then use this information to guide customers to the products they are looking for, either by directing them to the exact shelf or by displaying a map of the store on a screen. This would eliminate the need for customers to search for products on their own, which can be time-consuming and frustrating.\n\nIn terms of preparing food, robots could be used to automate tasks such as chopping vegetables, mixing ingredients, and cooking food. This would not only save time but also ensure that the food is prepared consistently and to the customer's specifications. For example, if a customer orders a salad, the robot could chop the vegetables to the exact size and shape they prefer, and mix them with the dressing to their liking. This would result in a more personalized and enjoyable dining experience.\n\nOverall, the use of robots in a futuristic grocery store would greatly enhance the shopping experience by making it more efficient, convenient, and personalized."}

Khin Maung Latt was a football player who had died in a car accident a few months earlier.

We are working to build relationships across racial lines, to listen to the voices of those who have been marginalized by our society, and to work together to build a more just and equitable society. This work is not easy, and it is often uncomfortable, but it is essential if we are to be faithful followers of Jesus Christ.\nI have learned a lot from my friends and colleagues in the racial reconciliation movement, and I have been inspired by their commitment to this work. However, I have also learned that we cannot do this work alone.
