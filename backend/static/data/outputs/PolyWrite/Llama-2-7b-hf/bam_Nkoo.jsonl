I was busy preparing for the next day’s lesson. I had just finished making copies of the lesson plan when the door to my classroom burst open.

I couldn’t speak.\nThe man put the gun back in his holster and walked out of the classroom. I was left there, lying on the floor, bleeding out.\nI didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know where to turn.

I asked God to please help me. I asked Him to please save me.\nI don’t know how long I lay there, but eventually, I heard footsteps coming down the hallway. I opened my eyes and saw a group of people running toward me. They were all wearing white coats. They were all doctors and nurses.\nThey rushed to my side and began to work on me. They put me on a gurney and took me to the operating room. I was scared, but I knew that I was in good hands.\nI woke up in the hospital a few days later. I was in a lot of pain, but I was alive.
