Lam.) and its yield. The study was conducted in the experimental farm of the Department of Horticulture, Yezin Agricultural University, Yezin, Pyin Oo Lwin, Myanmar. The experiment was carried out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The treatments were two types of soil (clay and sandy soil) and two levels of soil moisture (well-watered and water-stressed) with three replications. The results showed that the highest yield of sweet potato was obtained in the sandy soil under well-watered condition. The highest yield of sweet potato was obtained from sandy soil at 105.85 t ha-1. The lowest yield was obtained from clay soil under water-stressed condition at 41.45 t ha-1.
