The term was originally coined to describe a female character who is a parody of the perfect woman, but it has since been applied to both male and female characters who are so perfect that they're unrealistic.\nThe problem with Mary Sues is that they're not realistic. They're unbelievable and unrelatable. They're not human. They're not like us. They're perfect. And that's the problem.\nSo, what do you do if you want to write a Mary Sue? Well, the first thing you need to do is to make sure that your character is actually a Mary Sue. If they're not, then you're probably not going to have much luck writing them.\nThe second thing you need to do is to make sure that your character is actually interesting. If they're not, then they're probably not going to be very popular.\nThe third thing you need to do is to make sure that your character is actually likable. If they're not, then they're probably not going to be very popular.\nThe fourth thing you need to do is to make sure that your character is actually relatable. If they're not, then they're probably not going to be very popular.\nThe fifth thing you need to do is to make sure that your character is actually believable.

To how extent yuh agree or disagree wid dis statement?", "output": "\nSome people believe that it is more difficult to achieve work-life balance in today’s society than it was in the past. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nIt is widely believed that it is more difficult to achieve work-life balance in today’s society than it was in the past. I believe that this is true because of the following reasons.\nFirstly, there are more demands on our time today. In the past, most people had a job that they did for the majority of their waking hours. Nowadays, people are expected to work long hours and take on extra responsibilities outside of their job. This means that there is less time for other activities, such as spending time with family or pursuing hobbies.\nSecondly, the pace of life has increased. In the past, people had more time to relax and take things at a slower pace. Nowadays, everything seems to be happening faster, which can make it difficult to find time for other activities.\nFinally, there is more competition for our time. In the past, people had fewer demands on their time and were able to focus on the things that were important to them. Nowadays, there are more distractions and people are constantly bombarded with information, which can make it difficult to focus on anything for long periods of time.\nIn conclusion, I believe that it is more difficult to achieve work-life balance in today’s society than it was in the past. This is because there are more demands on our time, the pace of life has increased and there is more competition for our time.\nSome people believe that it is more difficult to achieve work-life balance in today’s society than it was in the past.

The world has always been connected through trade, travel, and communication. However, in recent years, the pace of globalization has increased dramatically.
