I believe that both views have their own merits and demerits and I will discuss both of them in this essay.\nOn the one hand, tackling global warming globally is a more efficient way to solve the problem. The reason is that, in order to deal with this problem, we need to cut down the emission of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. As we all know, the emission of greenhouse gases comes from many sources, such as transportation, industry, and so on. So, in order to deal with this problem, we need to make changes in all these aspects. As a result, tackling this problem globally is a more effective way to solve the problem.\nOn the other hand, tackling global warming locally is also a good way to deal with it. The reason is that the emission of greenhouse gases varies from one place to another. So, if we want to tackle this problem, we need to make changes in each area. For example, some countries have a higher emission of greenhouse gases than others. In this case, tackling this problem locally is a more effective way to deal with it.\nIn conclusion, both tackling global warming globally and tackling it locally have their own merits and demerits. I believe that both ways are effective in dealing with this problem.\nGlobal warming is one of the major environmental problems in the world. Some people believe that the only way to solve this problem is to tackle it globally. Others, however, think that local measures are more effective. I believe that both views have their own merits and demerits and I will discuss both of them in this essay.\nOn the one hand, tackling global warming globally is a more efficient way to solve the problem.
