I’ll be discussing the role of the Nigerian Army in the Nigerian Civil War.\nThe Nigerian Civil War, also known as the Biafra War, was a civil war that took place in Nigeria from 1967 to 1970. The war was fought between the Nigerian government, led by General Yakubu Gowon, and the secessionist state of Biafra, led by the Biafran leader, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu.\nThe Nigerian Army played a key role in the Nigerian Civil War. The Nigerian Army was responsible for the majority of the fighting on the Nigerian side of the war, and it was also responsible for the majority of the casualties on both sides of the war.\nThe Nigerian Army was also responsible for the majority of the atrocities that were committed during the war. The Nigerian Army was responsible for the majority of the massacres that took place during the war, and it was also responsible for the majority of the rapes and other forms of sexual violence that took place during the war.\nThe Nigerian Army was also responsible for the majority of the human rights abuses that took place during the war.
