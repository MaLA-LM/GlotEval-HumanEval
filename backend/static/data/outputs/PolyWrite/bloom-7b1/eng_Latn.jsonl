The BMI is calculated by dividing the weight (in kilograms) by the square of the height (in meters). The BMI is a measure of obesity that takes into account both weight and height, but it is not the only measure of obesity. There are also other measures of obesity, such as the waist-to-hip ratio and waist circumference. The WHO recommends that the BMI should be used to measure obesity, but that other measures of obesity should also be taken into account.\nThe WHO has developed recommendations for the prevention and treatment of obesity. These recommendations are intended to help countries and health professionals develop policies and strategies to prevent and treat obesity. The recommendations are based on a review of the scientific literature and on consensus among experts. They are designed to be practical and to be implemented at the local level.\nThe recommendations for the prevention and treatment of obesity have been adopted by the WHO in 2008. The recommendations are aimed at adults and children and are based on the following principles:\nThe WHO recommends that adults should aim to achieve a BMI of 20 to 25 kg/m2 and that children should aim to achieve a BMI of less than 25 kg/m2. These recommendations are based on the results of a systematic review of the scientific literature that was conducted by the WHO in 2008. The systematic review of the scientific literature was undertaken to determine whether the current evidence suggested that a BMI of less than 25 kg/m2 was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, certain types of cancer, and other health problems. The systematic review of the scientific literature was based on the findings of studies that had been published up to 2007.

What are the causes of these problems, and what measures can be taken to improve the situation?", "output": " This article looks at the causes of air pollution in cities and the effects on people. It also looks at the measures that can be taken to reduce pollution, and the potential benefits for health and the environment.\nThe key to reducing air pollution is to reduce the amount of emissions from cars, trucks and other vehicles. This can be achieved by improving fuel efficiency, and by reducing the number of vehicles on the roads. Improving the efficiency of vehicles can also help to reduce air pollution in cities. This is because cars that are more fuel efficient also emit less carbon dioxide and other pollutants. Reducing the number of cars on the roads can also help to reduce air pollution in cities. The fewer cars that are on the roads, the less traffic there is, and the less pollution that is produced.\nIn many cities, the number of cars on the roads is increasing, and this is causing air pollution to rise. The number of cars on the roads in cities is increasing because people are living in cities and are using cars to get around. The number of cars on the roads is also increasing because people are buying more cars. This is because many people believe that cars are a more convenient way to get around. However, cars are also causing air pollution in cities. People are using cars to travel to work, and this is causing air pollution in cities.
